        "q": "What is a building permit jurisdiction (AHJ)?",
        "a": "An AHJ, or authority-having jurisdiction, is the government entity responsible for issuing building permits in a given area. Some cities issue their own permits, while others delegate permitting to the county. Shovels identified over 10,000 such jurisdictions across the United States."
      },
      {
        "q": "How do I know if my city issues its own building permits or if the county handles them?",
        "a": "If a city appears on the Shovels jurisdiction list, it issues its own building permits. If a city is not on the list, the county is likely the authority-having jurisdiction for building permits in that area."
      },
      {
        "q": "Where can I download the list of building permit jurisdictions?",
        "a": "The dataset is available for free on Kaggle at the Building Permit Jurisdictions in the United States dataset page, or you can download the CSV file directly from the Shovels website."

      {
        "q": "Why does Pennsylvania have so many building permit jurisdictions compared to other states?",
        "a": "Pennsylvania has 1,575 permit jurisdictions, far more than any other state, and roughly 3 times as many as Ohio despite having a similar population. The exact reason for this is unclear, but it stands out as a significant outlier, with 12.15 jurisdictions per 100,000 residents compared to the national average of about 10 jurisdictions per county."

        "q": "How many building permits were issued in the US in Q1 2025?",
        "a": "The US saw approximately 2.02 million building permits in Q1 2025, which is a 6.1% decline from Q4 2024's 2.16 million. While this represents the third consecutive quarter of decreases since the peak in Q2 2024, the rate of decline is slowing compared to the 12.5% drop between Q3 and Q4 2024."

        "q": "Which counties saw the biggest growth in building permits during Q1 2025?",

      {
        "q": "How are tariffs and interest rates affecting new construction permits?",
        "a": "New tariffs introduced in early 2025, including a 25% charge on steel and aluminum imports, are increasing building costs. Combined with persistently high interest rates that raise borrowing costs and reduce home affordability, builders are being more cautious. New construction permits fell 7.2% from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025, dropping to 134,000."
      },
      {
        "q": "Who are the top home builders by permit volume in Q1 2025?",
