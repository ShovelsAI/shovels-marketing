        "q": "What is a building permit jurisdiction (AHJ)?",
        "a": "An AHJ, or authority-having jurisdiction, is the government entity responsible for issuing building permits in a given area. Some cities issue their own permits, while others delegate permitting to the county. Shovels identified over 10,000 such jurisdictions across the United States."
      },
      {
        "q": "How do I know if my city issues its own building permits or if the county handles them?",
        "a": "If a city appears on the Shovels jurisdiction list, it issues its own building permits. If a city is not on the list, the county is likely the authority-having jurisdiction for building permits in that area."

        "a": "Pennsylvania has 1,575 permit jurisdictions, far more than any other state, and roughly 3 times as many as Ohio despite having a similar population. The exact reason for this is unclear, but it stands out as a significant outlier, with 12.15 jurisdictions per 100,000 residents compared to the national average of about 10 jurisdictions per county."

        "a": "New tariffs introduced in early 2025, including a 25% charge on steel and aluminum imports, are increasing building costs. Combined with persistently high interest rates that raise borrowing costs and reduce home affordability, builders are being more cautious. New construction permits fell 7.2% from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025, dropping to 134,000."
