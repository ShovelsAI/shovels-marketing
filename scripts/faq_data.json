        "a": "Use the Contractor Directory feature to search by zip code and permit type. The app finds contractors based on their actual permit history in your area, which is more reliable than review sites since it shows who has actually done permitted work in your neighborhood."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I download data from the Shovels app?",

        "a": "The Shovels AI Custom GPT is a tool built on ChatGPT that interacts with the Shovels API using natural language. Instead of writing code or API calls, you can type plain-English requests like Show me all roofing permits in zip 90210 and get detailed results on building permits and contractors."
      },
      {
        "q": "Do I need to know how to code to use the Shovels GPT?",
        "a": "No. The Shovels Custom GPT accepts natural language queries. You simply describe what you are looking for (permits, contractors, locations, dates) and the GPT handles the API interaction for you."
      },
      {
        "q": "What types of searches can I do with the Shovels Custom GPT?",
        "a": "You can search for building permits by type of work (e.g., roofing, pools, EV chargers), filter by state or zip code, set date ranges, and find contractors who specialize in specific types of work. The GPT covers data on over 113 million building permits and 3 million contractors across 48 states."
      },
      {
        "q": "What should I do if the GPT does not include contractor information in the results?",
        "a": "If the GPT returns permit data but does not list the associated contractors, simply ask it in a follow-up message. For example, type List the contractors too and the GPT will retrieve and display the contractor details."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "q": "What are the four permit statuses in the Shovels system?",
        "a": "The four statuses are: in_review (permit has been filed but not yet approved), active (permit is approved and work can proceed), final (work is completed and signed off by the jurisdiction), and inactive (the permit process has stalled due to failed inspections, expiration, or extended inactivity)."
      },
      {
        "q": "What dates correspond to each permit status in Shovels?",
        "a": "The in_review status is defined by the file_date (when the permit is filed). The active status is defined by the issue_date (when the permit is approved). The final status is defined by the final_date (when the jurisdiction signs off on completed work). The inactive status can occur at any point if the process stalls."
      },
      {
        "q": "What are start_date and end_date in the Shovels permit data?",
        "a": "These are derived dates created by Shovels for consistent date tracking. start_date is derived by coalescing file_date, issue_date, and final_date in that order. end_date uses the same fields in reverse order. Because of this, start_date and end_date can be the same value, and end_date may be populated even when a permit is still active. Use these fields together with the permit status for accurate analysis."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can a permit move back and forth between statuses?",
        "a": "Yes. A permit can move from active to inactive if the process stalls (for example, due to a failed inspection), and then return to active once the issue is resolved. The construction duration counter pauses during the inactive period and resumes when the permit becomes active again."

        "a": "Shovels aggregates permit data from thousands of jurisdictions, each with different reporting requirements. To cover all possible fields from all jurisdictions, the schema includes many fields that will be irrelevant to any individual permit. Blank fields typically fall into categories like optional professional contacts, project-specific details unrelated to the permit type, commonly unfilled fields like job value, or derived metrics that require data not present on older records."
      },
      {
        "q": "What are the most important fields to look at on a Shovels permit?",
        "a": "The top fields are: file_date, permit_number, owner_name, residential (whether it is a commercial or residential property), jurisdiction, type, subtype, status, description, and the address fields (street, street_no, zipcode, city, state). If any of these are empty, you can contact Shovels support to investigate."

      },
      {
        "q": "What format should the address be in when querying the API?",
        "a": "Use %20 to denote spaces in the address string. The address components (street number, street name, city, state, zip code) are passed as separate parameters joined with the & operator. The addresses returned by Shovels are formatted according to USPS standards."
      },
      {
        "q": "What should I do if my address does not appear in the Shovels search results?",
        "a": "There are several possible reasons: the address may not have any permits on record, the jurisdiction may not have digitized its permits yet, or the address may not be in Shovels' coverage area. You can check the Shovels Coverage Map to see available jurisdictions, or email support@shovels.ai for help."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can I retrieve multiple permits at once from the API?",

        "a": "Start by choosing your geography scale (state level for niche project types, zip code for common ones). Decide whether you are searching for permits or contractors based on your target persona. Apply key filters like minimum market value, lot size, or permit description keywords. Then spot-check results by clicking View Details on a few entries to verify accuracy."

        "q": "Is there a limit on how many records I can download from Shovels Online?",
        "a": "The Download List button caps at 1,000 rows per CSV export. To get more, adjust your filters slightly (such as changing geography) to generate a new set of 1,000 rows, then combine and deduplicate. For larger-scale needs, the Shovels API is recommended."

      {
        "q": "Why doesn't every address have a permit history in Shovels?",
        "a": "There are three main reasons: (1) the local jurisdiction may not require a permit for the type of work done, (2) even where permits are required, enforcement varies and some work is done without permits, and (3) the jurisdiction may not have digitized its permit records or made them available online yet."
      },
      {
        "q": "Do all jurisdictions require permits for the same types of projects?",
        "a": "No. There are no standardized nationwide rules mandating which work requires a permit. Requirements vary dramatically from one jurisdiction to another. Some states like Massachusetts have detailed requirements, while some rural counties may have minimal or no permitting requirements at all."
      },
      {

      },
      {
        "q": "What is the difference between Average Approval Duration and Average Construction Duration?",
        "a": "Average Approval Duration measures the time between when a permit is filed and when it is approved (issue_date minus file_date). Average Construction Duration measures the broader time between when a permit is filed and when it is marked as finaled (final_date minus file_date), encompassing the entire construction process."
      },
      {
        "q": "How is Average Inspection Pass Rate calculated?",
        "a": "It is the percentage of inspections passed compared to total inspections made, multiplied by 100 (so 75% is returned as 75). A higher rate, especially as a contractor's permit count increases, indicates a smoother construction process."
      },
      {
        "q": "What does the First Seen Date metric tell me?",
        "a": "For contractors, it shows the first time they appear in the Shovels system on a permit, which is useful for identifying new contractors entering the market. For permits, it shows when the permit was added to the Shovels platform, which helps you understand digitization delays or when historical data was backfilled."
