## Attivo Trail Omaha

The Attivo Trail Omaha just received a mixed-use district development agreement for Avenue One, allowing construction of a 612-unit multifamily project. The project, developed by Haverkamp Properties, is part of a larger "[grandest new neighborhood](https://avenueoneomaha.com/)" west of Omaha.

Avenue One - a live, work, play concept - looks to combine apartments, townhomes, and senior living with build-to-suit work concepts and a multitude of shop, dine, and stay experiences bounded by a central park.

This amendment ensures that the development aligns with the city's urban expansion plans and supports the growing demand for high-density residential housing in West Omaha.

*Editor's note: It's always great to find live, work, play concepts in the wild. We will be following the progress of this neighborhood closely.*

The City of Newark has approved a Community Benefits Agreement (CBA) with 930 McCarter Urban Renewal, LLC ([Boraie Development LLC](https://www.boraie.com/)), Elizabeth Development Company of New Jersey, and the New Jersey Economic Development Authority. This agreement is a condition for receiving tax credit incentives under the Aspire Program Act to support the construction of a 25-story high-rise mixed-use tower.

The project consists of 333 residential units, with 20% designated as affordable housing, 3,750 square feet of ground-floor retail space, and a four-story parking garage with 240 stalls. The total estimated project cost is approximately $170,193,254.

As part of the CBA, the developer will contribute $150,000 to Newark's Affordable Housing Trust Fund, provide $450,000 in landscaping improvements for Newark Riverfront Park, and sponsor a free summer movie series for children at Cityplex Movie Theater.

## Columbus Annexes 988.81 Acres

The Annexation, executed under the Expedited Type-1 Annexation Procedure, includes a portion of Hoover Reservoir and adjacent land. This annexation allows Columbus, OH, to provide municipal services and facilitates streamlined governance and potential future development opportunities.

## City Properties - Record Lot Sales & Auctions

This week we've seen a record volume (since tracking began in July 2024) of city-owned properties being sold or auctioned.

Noteworthy mentions include:

## Hamtramck, MI

Recognized as Michigan's densest and most walkable community, Hamtramck currently has an ongoing silent auction of [26 city-owned properties](https://go.boarddocs.com/mi/cohmi/Board.nsf/files/DE4NWZ61F7B8/$file/2025-City-Auction-Instructions-and-Application.pdf). Hamtramck's economic development manager, [Isabel Allaway](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabel-allaway-mpa-6a3552111/), mentioned that interested parties should contact her directly. She highlighted several key attributes of these parcels:

- **Vacant & Ready:** 25 out of 26 lots are vacant and immediately ready for construction.
- **Flexible Zoning:** All properties are zoned residential while permitting a broad array of commercial special land uses.
- **High-Density Development:** Each parcel can accommodate up to six apartment units by right.
- **Aggregation Opportunities:** Two clusters of three adjacent parcels present opportunities for larger developments such as condos or townhomes.

*Fun Fact: Hamtramck has probably the [simplest zoning map](https://hamtramckcity.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Hamtramck-Zoning-Map-1.pdf) I've ever seen.*
