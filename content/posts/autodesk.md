We had an exciting July here at Shovels. We added new customers, expanded our coverage, and found new use cases for our products. As part of our mission to make permit data useful, we constantly explore ways to integrate into the construction industry’s existing tools and systems –- and in July  we took a major step forward with Autodesk. 

**Shovels is now an [official partner with Autodesk’s Construction Cloud](https://www.autodesk.com/blogs/construction/14-new-integrations-for-autodesk-construction-cloud/)\!** 

Autodesk’s Construction Cloud is a leading tool in the building industry, used by millions of architects, contractors, and subcontractors to design, oversee, and execute complex projects across the world. ACC has a web of integrations enabling its users to access all aspects of a given project in one central hub. On July 30th, Autodesk announced that Shovels would be one of 14 new integrations available in ACC, bringing our data closer to the people who can make the most use of it.

This partnership means Autodesk Construction Cloud users can now integrate with Shovels, enabling them to access permit data from across the country, track timelines within jurisdictions, and identify key projects in development. While our current customers are already leveraging Shovels to find qualified contractors, generate leads, and navigate permitting processes, we are eager to see the new applications that will emerge out of this exciting collaboration with one of the leaders in the construction software space!
