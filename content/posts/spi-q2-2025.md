Welcome to the Shovels Quarterly Permit Index for Q2 2025, your go-to guide for all the latest construction and renovation trends happening across America. We've crunched the numbers and uncovered some pretty cool patterns in building activity, how fast permits get processed, and what's different from region to region. You'll see everything from a surprising boom in electrical permits to some unexpected states leading the pack in new construction. 

Whether you're a contractor, supplier, researcher, investor, or policy maker trying to navigate today's ever-changing construction scene, we've got insights you can actually use. Let's dive into the data that's shaping the future of our buildings and homes!

# 2025-Q2: The Big Picture

Our latest permit data reveals a comprehensive picture of construction and home improvement activity across diverse sectors during this dynamic quarter. While Reuters reports an [11-month decline in single-family starts](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-single-family-homebuilding-hits-11-month-low-building-permits-slump-2025-07-18/)‚Äîlikely due to labor shortages stemming from the administration's immigration crackdown, increased materials costs, and high interest rates‚Äîthe raw numbers tell a more nuanced story. 

In Q2 2025, Shovels recorded 712,060 permits with: `ISSUE_DATE BETWEEN '2025-04-01' AND '2025-06-30' AND APPROVAL_DURATION IS NOT NULL`. The defined issue date range ensures we only look at permits in Q2, and the approval duration only looks at permits with a file date AND issue date. We want to report on clean data, so these parameters help weed out permits with variable quality of record keeping. Of the 712,060 permits issued in Q2, here is the breakdown of permit statuses:

![2025 Q2 Permit Statuses]({static}/images/blog_images/2025-Q2-permit-statuses.jpg)

If we graph the states by permit count, the dominance of the top states is very clear. In a striking correlation between permit activity and insurance landscape, five states ‚Äì Florida, California, Texas, Louisiana, and North Carolina ‚Äì not only dominate the Q2 2025 construction permit scene but also represent critical hotspots in the national insurance risk matrix. These states account for nearly 65% of total permits and are simultaneously the most complex property insurance markets in the United States, characterized by heightened climate-related risks and evolving infrastructure challenges.

![2025 Q2 Top 25 States by Permit Count]({static}/images/blog_images/2025-Q2-top-25-states-by-permit-count.jpg)

These states represent the epicenter of catastrophe-related insurance claims. Coined an ‚Äú[insurance crisis in Gulf states](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/us/news/property/insurance-crisis-deepens-in-gulf-states-537234.aspx),‚Äù  insurers are increasingly denying or closing claims without payment, with a significant rise in claim denial rates. Florida consistently ranks as the state with the [highest property insurance cost](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2025/06/property-insurance.html) due to hurricane risks. California stands as the second-largest insurance market in the U.S. because of high wildfire and earthquake risk exposure. Texas' large insurance market is driven by frequent wind and hail damage claims while Louisiana and North Carolina both face similar challenges with hurricane and flood risks.

## New Construction Surges in Unlikely States

Many customers want to know what percentage of permits fall under the new construction permit category. Across the 62,660 nationwide new construction permits that Shovels tracked this quarter, we've analyzed the data state-by-state to reveal where the real building action is happening. 

<iframe title="New Construction as Percent of Total Permits" aria-label="Choropleth map" id="datawrapper-chart-HYwy6" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/HYwy6/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="734" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}})}();

# Permit Processing: The Rhythm of Bureaucratic Efficiency

In April 2025, the White House issued a transformative [Presidential Memorandum on Permitting Technology](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/updating-permitting-technology-for-the-21st-century/) that is already reshaping how building permits are processed nationwide. This comprehensive directive tackles longstanding inefficiencies in the environmental review and permitting process by mandating technological modernization across all federal agencies. By eliminating paper-based systems, reducing redundant submissions, and enhancing interagency coordination, this initiative aims to dramatically accelerate project timelines while maintaining thorough review standards. The following analysis of permit processing times reveals the early impact of these reforms and highlights significant variations across permit types and jurisdictions.

Our initial analysis of average permit processing times revealed significant data skewing due to outliers with extended APPROVAL_DURATION (file date to issue date). For instance, ADU permits averaged 177 days, solar permits 103 days, fire sprinkler 70 days, and new construction permits an extraordinary 238 days! 

To better understand the distribution of permit approval times, we analyzed each permit type across 9 duration bins. Here‚Äôs a sample of a few permit types:

![2025 Q2 Permit Approval Distribution]({static}/images/blog_images/2025-Q2-approval-distribution.jpg)

As shown, processing times vary dramatically across permit types, causing average values to skew significantly higher for certain categories. To present a more accurate picture of typical approval times, we've chosen to report median processing days instead. 

For context, the median represents the middle value when all processing times are arranged from shortest to longest, ensuring the data isn't influenced by extreme values. This means 50% of permits are processed faster and 50% slower than the median processing day reported.

![2025 Q2 Median Processing Days by Permit Type]({static}/images/blog_images/2025-Q2-median-processing-days-by-permit-type.jpg)

Looking at permit processing times by permit type uncovers clear patterns. Basic permits get processed quickly - plumbing, HVAC, and heat pump permits all take just 1 day (median). Roofing and gas permits need 2 days, while electrical permits require 4 days.

More involved projects take longer: bathroom remodels (5 days), solar installations (7 days), and kitchen renovations (7 days). Not surprisingly, the most complex projects require the most review time, with new construction taking 18 days and ADUs needing 19 days.

This data shows a permit system that effectively balances safety requirements with construction needs, processing simple permits quickly while giving necessary attention to complex projects.

| **PERMIT_TYPE** | **TOTAL_PERMITS** | **MEDIAN_PROCESSING_DAYS** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PLUMBING | 72957 | 1 |
| HVAC | 72874 | 1 |
| HEAT_PUMP | 5504 | 1 |
| ROOFING | 55459 | 2 |
| GAS | 16463 | 2 |
| ELECTRICAL | 106784 | 4 |
| BATHROOM | 11683 | 5 |
| SOLAR | 23631 | 7 |
| DEMOLITION | 9758 | 7 |
| KITCHEN | 2212 | 7 |
| FIRE_SPRINKLER | 11604 | 11 |
| POOL_AND_HOT_TUB | 9810 | 15 |
| ADDITION | 17831 | 16 |
| WINDOW_DOOR | 7698 | 16 |
| GENERATOR | 3326 | 16 |
| NEW_CONSTRUCTION | 62660 | 18 |
| ADU | 13140 | 19 |

Now let's deep dive into four key permit types that provide valuable insights into current construction and development trends across the country. Our analysis of ADUs, Solar installations, Fire Sprinkler systems, and New Construction reveals fascinating patterns in processing efficiency, regional variations, and potential economic indicators that matter to builders, investors, and policymakers alike.

## Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs): The Micro-Housing Revolution

There‚Äôs no denying the explosion of ADU popularity in recent years. ADUs, including basement apartments and garage flats, are a proven way to increase affordable housing supply. Also known as ‚Äúgranny flats‚Äù and ‚Äúin-law units‚Äù, they offer numerous benefits, such as reducing housing costs, supporting aging in place, and creating wealth-building opportunities. Most cities have successfully [implemented ADU programs](https://www.illinoispolicy.org/reports/chicagos-hidden-housing-solution-how-additional-dwelling-unit-expansion-can-make-city-more-affordable/).

There were a total of 13,140 ADU permits issued in Q2 of 2025. Our analysis reveals significant variations in processing times across counties, with Henderson County, NC ranking first in efficiency. The data shows a strong presence of North Carolina counties (4 of the top 10) in ADU permit processing speed, while California's Orange County also ranks among the leaders at #4. In April of 2025, The House Committee on Regulatory Reform in North Carolina gave [preliminary approval to a bill](https://www.wral.com/story/backyard-homes-couldn-t-be-blocked-by-north-carolina-cities-if-lawmakers-get-their-way/21982323/) that would allow many North Carolinians to build at least one ADU on their property, which might explain the high concentration in that state.

This regional efficiency suggests strategic prioritization of ADUs as housing solutions, particularly in areas facing affordability challenges. The quick turnaround times reflect how local governments are streamlining approval processes to support housing density and affordability initiatives through accessory dwelling units.

## Solar Surge: The Green Permit Revolution

The renewable energy industry watched anxiously as the current administration took office. They anticipated a period of uncertainty, which was confirmed when the [One Big Beautiful Bill Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Big_Beautiful_Bill_Act) passed in May 2025, significantly hampering renewable energy production and research across the United States. While this policy [began taking effect in Q2](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/16/interior-requires-burgum-sign-off-for-solar-wind-projects-00458999), its full impact won't be evident for several quarters. We'll continue monitoring solar permit trends closely in the coming months and years. 

Q2 2025 saw 23,631 solar permits issued across the country. The data reveals California's dominance in solar permit processing efficiency, with Los Angeles County leading the rankings followed by other California counties occupying seven of the top eight positions. Florida's Hillsborough County ranks ninth, while Hawaii's Honolulu County rounds out the top ten. These rankings reflect both the growing investment in renewable energy infrastructure and the streamlined permitting processes developed in these solar-friendly and sun-drenched regions.

# A Pivotal Moment in Construction: Resilience Amid Complexity

Looking at the Q2 2025 data, we see clear construction trends that matter for builders, developers, and investors. Despite challenges from new tariffs, labor shortages, and economic uncertainty, the numbers show remarkable resilience across the industry. The electrical permit surge in the Northeast, surprising new construction growth in Southeastern states, and concentrated roofing activity in climate-vulnerable regions all point to an industry that's adapting quickly to changing conditions.

These aren't just statistics‚Äîthey're signals of where the market is heading. As permitting processes become more efficient in places like North Carolina, and as contractors like DRB Group and Shea Homes show triple-digit quarterly growth, we're seeing the industry's remarkable ability to evolve. From ADUs in Wayne County to climate-adapted roofing in Florida, each permit represents concrete market intelligence you can use to make smarter business decisions.
