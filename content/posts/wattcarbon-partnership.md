Summer ‘24 continues to heat up here at Shovels, with recently announced partnerships with [Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/partners/our-partners/startups) and [Autodesk](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shovels_shovels-integration-autodesk-construction-activity-7216433428143955968-6c-C). Those are important commercial relationships. Today we’re announcing a partnership that’s meaningful for a different reason.

Our two-fold mission — making permit data useful AND supporting climate-friendly tech and initiatives — meant that we have a perfect opportunity to partner with [WattCarbon](https://www.wattcarbon.com/).

WattCarbon is a key player in the nascent EAC ([Energy Attribute Certificate](https://blog.wattcarbon.com/p/what-are-the-benefits-of-eacs)) Marketplace, aggregating different vendors and clean energy projects into one platform. They make it easy to invest in the kinds of climate-saving industries like solar arrays, wind farms, heat pumps, and many more. 

Today, we partnered with WattCarbon to set aside and invest a percentage of our quarterly revenue into their OpenEAC Exchange. Our US building permit dataset makes it easy to find contractors ready to work on any kind of climate-friendly or electrification projects, and we want to support this type of work.

Back in 2023 we started [a series analyzing EV charger construction](https://www.shovels.ai/blog/growth-of-ev-charging-in-california/) trends, and found that there’s still a lot of room to grow. Adoption of other electrification projects, especially heat pumps, are lagging behind solar and wind energy. However, investing in EACs with WattCarbon will finally allow decarbonization efforts (instead of only carbon-free projects) to be included in the bigger picture, and drive those numbers up. 

Check out [WattCarbon](https://www.wattcarbon.com/) to see how you can get involved with EACs, and [reach out to us](https://www.shovels.ai/contact) to talk more about this partnership and how Shovels supports electrification projects all over the country.
