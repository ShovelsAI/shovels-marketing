### **BAIZEL: The AI Wikipedia of Real Estate Business**

[BAIZEL](https://baizel.ai/) is redefining how commercial real estate professionals—from brokers and developers to engineers and architects—evaluate land and development opportunities. By combining powerful AI search with jurisdiction-normalized permit data from Shovels.ai, BAIZEL turns fragmented government records into lightning-fast insights. What once took weeks of manual research can now be done in minutes—with live permitting activity layered directly into the site selection workflow.

### **⚠️ The Challenge: Legacy Systems Slowed CRE Momentum**

Florida alone has over 400 permitting authorities, each using different formats, standards, and approval workflows. For years, real estate professionals had to cobble together insights from county websites or pay for outdated third-party data. This fragmented ecosystem buried opportunity beneath busywork and made it nearly impossible to gain real-time insight into development momentum or permitting pace.
