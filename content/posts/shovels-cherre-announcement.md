Earlier this week, we partnered with [Cherre](https://cherre.com/), the leading real estate data management and intelligence platform, to seamlessly integrate our construction intelligence with their existing system. 

Read more [on their blog](https://blog.cherre.com/2025/02/15/cherre-shovels-partnership-site-selection-portfolio-analysis) for the full details!

## Data Democratization

We’re big on making construction data (and our derived insights) as accessible as possible; that’s why we made an [API](https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference) and Free-Forever [web application](https://app.shovels.ai). But, we established early on that key partnerships with existing ecosystems will make that data even more accessible. 

That’s where Cherre came in.

Tons of clients are already utilizing Cherre’s platform for handling real estate investments, portfolios, and market analysis dashboards, so it was a no-brainer to look to piping our data directly into their system. 

Shovels provides the standardized, organized, and nationwide data (and tickerized to the stock market for easier-than-ever tracking for major companies!), and we let our insights work their magic in conjunction with the market analysis Cherre users are already doing for their clients.

## Unlocking Real Estate Insights

An integral part of this partnership was understanding the true value that the Shovels data can bring to a Cherre user. Data is one thing, and insights are even better, but a workflow is necessary to get the ball rolling and show exactly how the data can be leveraged. 

Here are some examples:

- Keep an eye on real estate supply by automatically tracking new construction permits.
- Streamline site-selection by combining construction and geo-spatial data with existing property criteria.
- Track construction trends and patterns across public REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) with tickerized and labeled data.
- so many more…

Get the best of both worlds by leveraging [Cherre](https://cherre.com/solutions/asset-management/) for your real estate analysis and management platform, and get Shovels data flowing directly to your dashboards today.
