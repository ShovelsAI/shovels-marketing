*__Local Land Use__ is a monthly feature that spotlights the most interesting city decisions nationwide. Enjoy!*

## Seattle Approves Housing in Stadium Transition Area Overlay District (STAOD)

The STAOD is only a short walk from Downtown Seattle and represents some of its most valuable land, including Lumen Field and T-Mobile Park.

On 3/18/25, 3 days after our last Local Land Use letter, the City Council passed Council Bill 120933, allowing residential uses as a conditional use within the STAOD. This removes prior prohibitions on housing within 200 feet of major truck streets.

However, housing developments must meet strict conditions, including at least 50% affordable units for 75 years (at 60%-90% AMI) and soundproofing to a maximum interior noise level of 45 dBA.
