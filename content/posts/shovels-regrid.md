We are pleased to announce our partnership with [Regrid](https://regrid.com/), a leading provider of comprehensive nationwide parcel data. This collaboration allows joint customers to combine critical parcel data from Regrid with Shovels' detailed building permit data, offering enhanced insights for mutual customers. As part of our partnership, we have added Regrid's UUID, the [Regrid ID](https://support.regrid.com/parcel-data/regrid-id) to Shovels' nationwide permit data, enabling easier data joining between the two datasets.

### **The Importance of Parcel Data**

Parcel data provides essential details about land ownership, boundaries, and usage, playing a critical role in real estate development, urban planning, site selection, and environmental analysis. Regrid provides a nationwide, standardized parcel dataset that includes a persistent and universal unique identifier, the [Regrid ID](https://support.regrid.com/parcel-data/regrid-id). This ID enables accurate tracking of each individual parcel, making it crucial for joining parcel data with other location datasets.

### **Joining Shovels and Regrid Data**

Shovels maintains a [standardized schema]({filename}../pages/data-dictionary.md) for nationwide building permit data, including latitude and longitude coordinates for each permit. By employing geospatial analysis, we can accurately link each building permit with Regrid's parcels via the Regrid ID.

This integration enables users to directly associate construction permit activities with specific parcels, enabling enhanced analysis of property boundaries, footprints, and current construction activity. If you're a Regrid and Shovels customer, you can now seamlessly join your parcel and permit datasets to gain more comprehensive visibility into property developments, streamline data analysis, and improve decision-making accuracy.

### **Benefits of Combined Data**

Combining parcel data and permit data delivers substantial advantages:

* **Improved Site Selection**: Identify development opportunities and areas of interest for your next project more efficiently by reducing manual data reconciliation and streamlining analysis.  
* **Enhanced Market Analysis**: Gain deeper insights into properties and neighborhood developments by efficiently correlating permits with property assessment data and land-use changes.  
* **Risk Assessment**: Improve compliance monitoring by quickly identifying potential zoning and regulatory issues through integrated parcel and permit data analysis.Improve compliance monitoring by quickly identifying potential zoning and regulatory issues through integrated parcel and permit data analysis.  
* **Operational Efficiency**: Reduce the effort needed to cross-reference datasets.  
* **Esri ArcGIS Compatibility**: Shovels and Regrid data are available as ArcGIS hosted feature layers.
