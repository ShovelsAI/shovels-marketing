In the fourth episode of our podcast, "What I Learned This Week In Proptech," we delved into a vital aspect of any business, especially in the fast-paced world of proptech: hiring the right talent. Fernando and I discussed our experiences and insights, offering a fresh perspective on this challenging yet crucial process.

## Understanding the Importance of Attitude over Pedigree

One of the first lessons we've learned is the paramount importance of attitude over academic pedigree. In proptech, where innovation and adaptability are key, a candidate's mindset can often be a greater asset than their educational background. This approach is particularly pertinent in startups, where a flexible and positive attitude is crucial for navigating the uncertain waters of the industry.

## The Art of Identifying Potential

Identifying potential in candidates can be challenging, and we often find that traditional markers like academic achievements or previous job titles don't always paint the full picture. We've learned to look deeper, seeking signs of creativity, problem-solving abilities, and a genuine passion for proptech. These qualities often indicate a candidate's ability to grow and adapt within a dynamic field.

## The Role of 'Homework' in the Hiring Process

Assigning 'homework' or practical tasks during the hiring process can be a valuable tool. This approach allows us to assess a candidate's real-world skills and how they approach problem-solving. It's an effective way to gauge not only their technical abilities but also their commitment and enthusiasm for the role.

## Why Writing Skills Matter

In the remote working environment that dominates proptech, clear and effective communication is essential. We place a high value on writing skills, as they are often indicative of a candidate's ability to think clearly and communicate effectively, both of which are critical in a fast-moving and often complex industry.

## The Value of Diverse Backgrounds and Perspectives

In proptech, innovation is key, and diverse backgrounds can be a significant asset. We've learned to value candidates who bring different perspectives and experiences to the table. This diversity fosters a culture of creativity and can lead to innovative solutions and approaches in the proptech space.

## Balancing Technical Skills with Cultural Fit

While technical skills are undoubtedly important, we've learned that a candidate's fit within the team and the company culture is equally vital. We look for individuals who not only have the necessary skills but who also share our passion for proptech and our vision for the future of the industry.

## The Importance of Passion and Curiosity

Passion and curiosity are qualities we highly value in candidates. Individuals who are genuinely excited about proptech and continually seek to learn and grow within the field are likely to be valuable assets to our team.

## Embracing Flexibility and Adaptability

The proptech industry is ever-evolving, and we need team members who can adapt to changes and embrace new challenges. Flexibility and adaptability are crucial traits that we look for in candidates, as they are essential for success in a dynamic and rapidly changing sector.

## Conclusion: Crafting a Successful Team in Proptech

Building a successful team in proptech requires a nuanced approach to hiring. By focusing on attitude, potential, communication skills, and cultural fit, and by valuing diversity, passion, and adaptability, we can assemble a team capable of driving innovation and success in the proptech industry.

As we continue to explore and learn in the world of proptech, these hiring strategies will remain central to our efforts in cultivating a dynamic and effective team, ready to meet the challenges and seize the opportunities that lie ahead in this exciting field.
