## Base10 Partners leads funding for company processing 170M+ permits across 20,000+ jurisdictions

*Lafayette, CA – June 10, 2025* – We're excited to announce that Shovels has closed a $5 million seed round led by Base10 Partners. This brings our total funding to $6.5 million and accelerates our mission to make building permit data actionable for the construction industry.

### Why This Matters

We've built AI-native infrastructure to solve the construction industry's data fragmentation problem. Building permit data is scattered across 20,000+ jurisdictions nationwide, making it previously inaccessible or unusable for most companies.

Shovels has developed proprietary technology that handles the complexity of government data extraction. Our AI-powered scrapers are optimized for diverse government systems, with intelligent classification and enrichment across jurisdictions, plus continuous validation and cleansing of data streams.

### What We've Built

Our platform processes 170 million building permits across 30 million US addresses. We maintain profiles on 3 million contractors and add 5 million new permits monthly through automated extraction and enrichment.

We offer comprehensive coverage across 20,000+ jurisdictions, real-time processing of new permits, contractor intelligence with detailed work histories, and multiple access points including API, web interface, and direct cloud integrations to Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks.

### Proven Results

Our customers see measurable improvements. Beam, a construction software company, integrated our data into their lead generation process with clear results.

"Integration of Shovels data in Beam's cold outreach strategy resulted in a remarkable 20 to 30% higher likelihood of contractor engagement," according to their case study. "The periodic data updates from Shovels helped fill Beam's sales pipeline with prospects and helped the Beam team nurture awareness which subsequently transformed to consideration and high purchase intent among their target customers."

Haven, a climate tech company, provides additional validation: "Shovels has been a great partner to Haven. They've not only provided the permit data we were looking for in a timely manner, but have worked to understand our strategy so they can be a partner in achieving results rather than just a source of raw data."

Our data enables precise targeting: solar companies identify homeowners with active roofing permits for installation opportunities, home improvement retailers target major renovation projects, and government agencies access granular building trends for economic development planning.

### Market Validation

"Shovels has a rare and massive opportunity to become the definitive source of truth for high-value, hard-to-access datasets at the local government level," said Rexhi Dollaku, general partner at Base10 Partners.

Our customer base spans from early-stage startups to publicly-traded companies. We recently launched the [Quarterly Permit Index](https://www.shovels.ai/blog/shovels-quarterly-permit-index-q1-2025/), tracking construction trends nationwide. The Q1 2025 report found 134,000 new construction permits issued nationally, down 7.2% from Q4 2024\.

### Use of Funds

The $5 million will be used to expand our team, enhance our AI infrastructure for processing government data, and accelerate coverage expansion into additional datasets beyond building permits. We're also investing in advanced analytics capabilities and platform development tools.

### What's Next

We're expanding into additional government datasets beyond permits while maintaining our focus on data quality and accessibility. The construction industry represents $1.8 trillion annually and remains significantly underdigitized compared to other sectors.

Our priorities include enhanced coverage with deeper data extraction across existing markets, new data sources from additional government and regulatory datasets, advanced analytics with predictive modeling for market trends, and platform development including tools for permit portfolio management.

### About the Technology

Our AI-native approach processes unstructured government data at scale. We offer multiple interfaces—API, web application, and direct data feeds to major cloud platforms—serving different customer needs and technical requirements.

We maintain transparency about our coverage and limitations, providing customers with clear understanding of data availability and quality across jurisdictions.
