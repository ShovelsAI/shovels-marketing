This Terms of Service Agreement (the “Agreement”) explains the basic terms and conditions (“Terms and Conditions”) by which you may access and use Shovels’s website, Application Programming Interface (API), and any other web-based tools, data features, functionalities, and other services (collectively, the “Service”). Additional services, including for enterprise clients, may be subject to different terms or additional agreements.

YOU SHOULD READ THIS TERMS OF SERVICE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. AS OUTLINED IN SECTION 8 BELOW, THEY INCLUDE A MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.

6.        Third-Party Content and Assumption of Risk
----------------------------------------------------

(a)        Generally
--------------------

The Service may transmit, include, store, or make available certain third-party content or third-party services (the “Third-Party Content”). Third-Party Content may include, without limitation: (1) raw or enriched data related to construction and permitting; (2) any other information, data, content, services, software, analysis, infographics, or products related to construction and permitting; and (3) third-party names, logos, product and service names, trade names, trademarks and services marks.

Shovels does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, prepare, edit, warrant, inspect, verify, or make any representations with respect to Third-Party Content, and does not purport to take responsibility for or guarantee the substance, correctness, timeliness, completeness, usefulness, or delivery of Third-Party Content. Moreover, Shovels is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from third-party sites. Specifically, Shovels encourages all users to independently verify messages received through the Service, particularly before engaging in a transaction with financial consequences.

You will not hold Shovels liable in any way for (a) any inaccuracy of, error or delay in, or omission of the Third-Party Content; or (b) any loss or damage arising from or occasioned by: (i) any error or delay in the transmission of such Third-Party Content; (ii) interruption in any such Third-Party Content due either to any negligent act or omission by any party to any “force majeure” (e.g., flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, epidemic, pandemic, public health crisis, or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection, riot, labor dispute, accident, action of government, communications or power failure, equipment or software malfunction), or (iii) to any other cause beyond the reasonable control of Shovels, or iv) non-performance.

(b)        Your Assumption of Risk
----------------------------------

Third-Party Content is not intended to provide financial, legal, tax, or investment advice or recommendations. Shovels is not responsible for any actions taken by you through this Service or based on the information on the Service or Third-Party Content. Shovels strives to present the most updated and correct information available, but the Third-Party Content presented may not necessarily be accurate (due to third-party actions, programming errors, API issues, or other reasons), may be superseded by changes in data sourcing, force majeure events, market conditions, and/or changes in applicable laws, regulations, and other government actions. You agree not to hold Shovels liable for any possible claim for damages arising from any decision you make based on the Service or Third-Party Content. Past performance data should not be construed as indicative of future results.

7.        Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability
--------------------------------------------------

The Third-Party Content and Service are provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Shovels expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind with respect to Third-Party Content and Service, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Shovels does not guarantee the accuracy, timeliness, completeness or usefulness of any Third-Party Content. You agree to use Third-Party Content and the Service only at your own risk and that Shovels is not responsible for how you choose to use its Service or Third-Party Content.

SHOVELS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, INCOME, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF SHOVELS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM: (1) THE USE OF OR THE INABILITY TO USE THIRD-PARTY CONTENT OR THE SERVICE; (2) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES PURCHASED OR OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO, THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICE; (3) ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT, DATA, TRANSMISSIONS, OR DATA DUE TO YOUR CONDUCT, INACTION OR NEGLIGENCE; OR (4) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THIRD-PARTY CONTENT OR THE SERVICE.

8.        Arbitration
---------------------

Please read this section (“Arbitration Clause”) carefully. It is part of your agreement with Shovels and affects your rights.

THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Clause. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Shovels in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND SHOVELS WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.

ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.

The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision; the arbitrator shall apply California law to all other matters. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues related to scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any party to the arbitration may at any time seek injunctions or other forms of equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction.

Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: Shovels, Inc., 3515 Mt. Diablo Blvd Unit #51, Lafayette, California 94549. After the Notice is received, you and Shovels may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Shovels do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.

Arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) before a single AAA arbitrator under the AAA’s rules, which are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and costs will be governed by the AAA's rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and not appealable, and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. This Arbitration Clause shall survive expiration, termination, or rescission of this Agreement.

9.        Indemnification
-------------------------

You will indemnify and hold harmless Shovels and its officers, directors, agents, partners, employees, licensors, distributors, representatives, and affiliates from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, causes of action, suits, proceedings, losses, damages, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising from or relating to your access and/or use of or interaction with the Third-Party Content, or any act, error, or omission of your use of your account or any user of your account, in connection therewith, including, but not limited to, matters relating to incorrect, incomplete, or misleading information; libel; invasion of privacy; infringement of a copyright, trade name, trademark, service mark, or other intellectual property; any defective product or any injury or damage to person or property caused by any products sold or otherwise distributed through or in connection with the Service; or violation of any applicable law.

10.        Service Fees
-----------------------

Certain features of the Service may be provided without charge (for free). These features may not always be offered for free. Premium or enterprise-grade features (including trial periods) may additionally be offered on a fee-for-service basis, or with a paid subscription, subject to additional Terms and Conditions or technical limitations (e.g., a maximum number of API calls or limited geographic scope of data) which will be posted in connection with such features. Fees and rates are subject to change without notice. You acknowledge and agree that Shovels may add features or services to the Service for which it receives or pays service fees (e.g., fixed fee or percentage), commission, or other compensation from or to third-parties.

11.        Termination
----------------------

You agree that, without notice, Shovels may terminate these Terms and Conditions, or suspend your access to the Service or the Third-Party Content, with or without cause at any time and effective immediately. These Terms and Conditions will terminate immediately without notice from Shovels if you, in Shovels’s sole determination, fail to comply with any provision of these Terms and Conditions. Shovels shall not be liable to you or any third party for the termination or suspension of the Service or the Content, or any claims related to such termination or suspension. Shovels may discontinue or modify the Third-Party Content, or any portion thereof, at any time. You release and agree to indemnify and hold harmless Shovels for any loss or damages arising from or relating to such discontinuation or modification. If you are paying for a premium feature or service and Shovels terminates the Service, then your payment obligations will terminate at the end of the applicable subscription period (e.g., monthly / quarterly). For paying customers, no refunds are otherwise available except as required by law.

12.        Applicable Law and Venue
-----------------------------------

You agree that this Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. To the extent allowable, beyond the arbitration clause below, any legal action or proceeding arising under this Agreement will be brought exclusively in courts located in Contra Costa County, California, and you irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein.

13.        Severability
-----------------------

If any provision of this Agreement is deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from every other provision of the Agreement, and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.

14.        Revisions to these Terms and Conditions
--------------------------------------------------

Shovels may at any time revise these Terms and Conditions by updating this Agreement. You agree to be bound by subsequent revisions and agree to review these Terms and Conditions periodically for changes. The most updated version of this document will be available for your review under the “Terms of Service” link that appears on Shovels’s website.
