    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-6">About Shovels</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">At Shovels, we're reshaping the construction and real estate industries by transforming fragmented building permit and contractor data into actionable, game-changing insights. Backed by multi-million-dollar VC funding and a growing customer base, we're taking on one of the world's largest yet most underutilized data-rich sectors - using advanced pipelines and AI to bring structure, clarity, and value to messy, fragmented data.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">What started as two people with a big vision has grown into a team of dedicated engineers and data enthusiasts distributed across the globe. We've come a long way from our pre-seed days, but we're still scrappy, collaborative, and all-in on building something amazing together.</p>

Twice a year, we bring everyone together for in-person team summits to connect, strategize, and celebrate our progress.</p>
