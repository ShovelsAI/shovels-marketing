          <strong>We're looking for a Senior Engineer</strong> to join our small, fast-moving team.
          This isn't a narrow role - you'll work across data pipelines, APIs, distributed infra,
          and autonomous AI systems. Each engineer commands a team of AI agents that research
          government portals, build API features, implement ETL pipelines, refactor code,
          query and reason about data, and accelerate development 10x.
          We're not using AI as a coding assistant - we're building systems where humans
          direct strategy and AI agents execute. This is the bleeding edge.

          When a trillion-dollar economy leans on building permits as its leading signal,
          you realize just how powerful our data is - and why we're obsessed with structuring it.

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-6">About Shovels</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">At Shovels, we're reshaping the construction and real estate industries by transforming fragmented building permit and contractor data into actionable, game-changing insights. Backed by multi-million-dollar VC funding and a growing customer base, we're taking on one of the world's largest yet most underutilized data-rich sectors - using advanced pipelines and AI to bring structure, clarity, and value to messy, fragmented data. Now we're building the next generation of construction data intelligence: a generative analytics platform that uses AI to understand what customers need and dynamically creates the perfect interface for their specific analysis - from search to visualization to data extraction.</p>
    <p>What started as two people with a big vision has grown into a team of dedicated engineers and data enthusiasts distributed across the globe. We've come a long way from our pre-seed days, but we're still scrappy, collaborative, and all-in on building something amazing together.</p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-6">The Opportunity</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">This is not just another engineer job - it's a chance to <strong>shape the core of a company that's going places fast</strong>. As a <strong>Senior Engineer</strong>, you'll work across <strong>distributed scraping systems, data pipelines, REST APIs, gen AI tooling, and cloud infrastructure</strong>. Full-stack work with real depth in each area. You'll have the <strong>autonomy to solve challenging problems and build robust systems</strong> while working with a modern tech stack that's constantly evolving.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">We're not hiring for a narrow, specialized role. You'll join a <strong>small, core team of engineers</strong> who take on <strong>interdisciplinary challenges</strong> and <strong>own all parts of the stack</strong> - from data pipelines to API development and infrastructure.</p>
    <p>Whether you're tuning distributed systems, optimizing data pipelines, or brainstorming with the team, you'll <strong>make a real impact</strong> here.</p>
