      Shovels is building the Google for local government data: collecting, cleaning, and making useful all of the public government data that is not publicly available. This is a huge mission with a massive upside, and we already know that this data, when properly sold, is very valuable.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      <strong>As an Enterprise Account Executive, you get to sell Shovels to very sophisticated buyers at very large enterprises.</strong> Our current customers are among the most valuable and recognizable companies in the world.

      You'll receive ample training and have direct access to company leadership, but we expect you to have the ability to self-direct and find your way and be a thought partner with us. We're a small team and we're all wearing multiple hats; you'll need to figure it out <em>and</em> not be shy about asking for help. This is the Shovels way!
