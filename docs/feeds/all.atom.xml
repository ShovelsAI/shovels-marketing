With Shovels, we address the agency problem in the trades by providing comprehensive data on contractors' permits, inspections, and key metrics across multiple jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Ryan Buckley sent this newsletter about the launch of Shovels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hello friends, advisors, and (a few) relatives! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of a hiatus, I'm really excited to launch a new company along with an incredible team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process has been a journey. Thanks again to those of you who suffered through my many explanations of half-baked ideas and more than a few false starts. This time is different! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pleased to introduce Shovels, a new way to discover and evaluate building contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's an agency problem in the trades. In my economics classes we called it "information asymmetry," a term popularized by Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz who proved that this asymmetry leads to inefficient markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, you don't need an economics degree to know that hiring a home contractor is fraught with risk. Just talk to anyone who's done it. More often than not, and far more frequently than any other hiring decision I can think of, it's a bad experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is contractors have far more knowledge of their skill level and fit for the job than the people who hire and finance them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What we do&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels does a few things to address the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We scrape all permits and associate them with contractors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We include all permit inspections and their results &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do this across multiple jurisdictions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we crunch the numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is a very compelling new way to look at contractor skill level and job fit. We're calculating new metrics like inspection pass rate and construction speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These metrics are predictive of project outcomes: we know what good and bad contractors look like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hear over and over again how the entire construction industry is slow to adopt new technology. The field is littered with startups who failed to get contractors to adopt a new app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we're not trying to be in the field. Instead, we're in the offices of the people who decide who to hire and fund and we gather data from the municipalities that issue and inspect building permits. This part of the construction industry is moving online and we're able to take advantage of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What we built&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prototype is live! It only has Contra Costa County data (about five years worth) but it's enough to see who the major builders are and it shows their key metrics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it out: https://app.shovels.ai/register/. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What we're building next&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to pull in seven of the nine Bay Area counties this month. That effort will really showcase the power of Shovels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most contractors work in multiple counties and this data isn't centralized anywhere. It takes some heavy technical lifting to grab it all, but we have the expertise to do it. Once this historical data is pulled, we'll continue to update the open permits and grab new permits daily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The climate angle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been telling everyone that my next thing will be climate-related. That's still true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, our first paying customer is a climate tech company :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's very likely our first several paying customers will be green building contractors, financiers, consultants, and data aggregators. We'll be able to track the proliferation of green buildings and see who's doing the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on all that is here: https://www.shovels.ai/climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who we are&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but certainly not least, I want to share a couple of things about us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am co-founder and CEO. I just stepped away as CEO of MightySignal after Airnow acquired us last year. We did a ton of data scraping and analysis there and my own (great, fortunately) experience with a major home remodel inspired Shovels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luka Kacil is my co-founder and CTO. He is supremely talented and someone I look forward to being in the trenches with. We met through MightySignal when we acquired his company, AppMonsta, back in 2019. He built and managed the tech stack to scrape all of the Google Play and Apple App stores daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have a small team of part-time folks doing hands-on work in data analysis and marketing support.&lt;/p&gt;

Despite facing new challenges that have slowed us down, they have only fueled our determination to create more value. We've had great conversations with potential customers who align perfectly with our ideal profiles. Our back-office operational tasks are well underway, and we've also made strides in fundraising. While we received an offer from a venture studio, we decided to prioritize raising a seed round instead. With my co-founder Luka diligently collecting data and my focus on revenue and fundraising, I'm confident that we're on the right track. Exciting times ahead! Happy holidays!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Shovels Dec 2022 Newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to share a few things I've been thinking about recently with this business, but I'll start with an ask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to talk to more real estate developers, especially if they're active in Contra Costa County or in the broader SF Bay Area. If you have a friendly one you can intro to me, I'd appreciate it! I want to understand how they vet and hire contractors.
That aside, here's a quick summary and then I'll get into more detail on each item. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've improved the way I describe the problem we're solving and our solution for fixing it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We encountered some new challenges that are slowing us down -- but also increasing our resolve because hey, the harder it is, the more value we're creating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had great conversations with people who match our three ideal customer profiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I made a bunch of progress on boring back office operational stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some fundraising progress was had&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Our problem and how we solve it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is information asymmetry in the labor market for the trades, and this mismatch leads to transactions that make both sides worse off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, that's the problem! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's one that homeowners, construction lenders, and real estate developers each have to deal with. The way we solve it is to aggregate building permit and related data and objectively assess the work that these guys do. We use source data to provide the transparency lacking in this market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach is unique, and I'll describe why in the next section. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New data challenges&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew aggregating this data would be hard. We didn't know it would be this hard. The challenge is several-fold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no clean public datasets for the detail we want to collect, so we have to find "interesting" ways to grab it.
Once we have it, the data is inconsistent and incomplete. It needs a good amount of TLC. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data is distributed among counties and cities, and isn't always online. Sometimes have to make public records requests to get it.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But that's what makes this work valuable and worth doing. It's also why no one else has already done it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will get easier, too -- I'm hearing directly from city clerks that they're in the process of bringing building permits online. That's encouraging, both for my co-founder Luka, who has to deal with most of this, and for us generally because it means our timing is good. It feels like we're catching the wave for clean, accessible government data, and we can be among the players that bring this critical trend* fully ashore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conversations with potential customers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke to several "bulls-eye" potential customers. They're exactly the profiles who would want to work with us. Here are a few takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The contractor marketplaces (Thumbtack, BuildZoom, etc) seem to refer contractors with whom they have referral agreements. It leads to bad matches and creates distrust on the buy side. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real estate developers already use public permit databases to see which contractors are active in a region. It's a tedious process that takes several hours to identify a single contractor. The time sink multiplies for every new jurisdiction they have to research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's no database available today to look up a property address and get its permit history. 
What does this mean to me? We have work to do! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These potential customers will remain "potential" until we can get more data coverage, which leads me to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Back office and fundraising&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels, Inc. is now officially a Delaware C-corp. We have a bank account, a Stripe account, and real paying customers. I have a CRM flush with conversations to stay on top of. This is a real milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get us even further, we will need to raise a small seed round. I'm talking every day to friends who are making introductions, advisors who critique our pitch deck, and people in the angel and venture investing community who are taking a hard look at Shovels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm hearing so far is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to describe the market size better. Luka and I are working on this, but there's no specific market report for what we do. Our total available market calculation is a bit haphazard. I know it's huge, but I have yet to prove it :) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more customers we get, the easier it will be to fundraise. I'm working on those customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Construction tech is a tricky area to fundraise. It's not your typical market and many investors shy away. They just don't get it. That's okay -- we're finding others who lean in right away. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently received our first offer. We were invited to join a venture studio that would handle a lot of the operations for us, effectively an "in-kind" investment of $500,000+. Ultimately we decided this one was not a great fit, so we're going to focus on raising a seed round instead. It was a good vote of confidence, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it for now. Luka is busy grabbing all the data we can in the SF Bay Area. I'm keeping the revenue and fundraising operation together. It's a grind, but I wouldn't rather be doing anything else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy holidays! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Our first newsletter is &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/introduction-to-shovels/"&gt;on the blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
* Why is taking building permits online critical? Let me ascend my climate change soapbox for a moment. Homes need to electrify. It's inevitable that every building will disconnect its gas line in the next 50 years. Getting there requires streamlining the bureaucratic mess that is building permits. We all hate it, so let's make it better. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category></entry><entry><title>February 2023 Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/february-2023-newsletter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-02-16T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-02-16T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-02-16:/blog/february-2023-newsletter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm excited to share the latest updates from Shovels and our journey in the world of building permit data. We've raised a seed round from reputable investors, allowing us to move forward with our plans. Our conversations with property technology and construction financing companies have been fruitful, and we're thrilled to have a roadmap and budget in place for the year ahead. We've also made progress in addressing data challenges, which are common in our field. I'm grateful for the support and advice we've received, and I'm looking forward to sharing more exciting news in our upcoming funding round announcement.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Shovels Feb 2023 Newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot to cover, so I'll summarize first and then get into some detail for those who wish to read on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We raised a seed round from legit investors and angels, and I plan to gather signatures and checks next week! We'll announce details soon thereafter. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've had dozens of great conversations with property technology and construction financing companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a roadmap and budget for the year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We increased our price to $1,000/mo per metro area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also continue to work through data challenges -- to be expected in this corner of the Internet. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Heroes" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/heroes.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pic of Luka and me amid a hero's journey through the mystical and enchanted world of building permit databases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I took this screenshot, we had recently discovered that there were 45 more permitting jurisdictions than we expected in the SF Bay Area. We'd just committed to a customer that we could scrape all of them. My screen froze during our meeting, and I took this pic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time, a friend and fellow entrepreneur texted me to ask how things were going with Shovels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've hit the bogs," I wrote back. "We're plodding through the shit." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's my favorite part!" he replied. Usually, it's mine too, but I was stressed and worried at that moment. What else had I underestimated? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did mention this was a hero's journey, right? A hero sets out on a high-risk adventure, encounters adversity, and overcomes it. The arc of entrepreneurship is one long hero's journey, but within that long arc are countless smaller ones. This data challenge is an example of one of those smaller arcs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll cut to the chase: we set out to grab all permits in the SF Bay Area. We encountered much more work than expected, fretted for a couple of weeks, and then found a solution. Huzzah! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're now purchasing raw permit and inspection data from a data vendor. Remarkably, this simple development led to a string of wins over the last couple of months. It's why I skipped the January newsletter -- I wanted to include the next win before sending it, and the wins just kept coming, so I never clicked send. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here we are in mid-February, so I'm just going to send. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lessons from our fundraise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's never easy, but I have to say, it felt like we had something akin to "investor-market-fit." The firms that passed did so for a few common reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're too early. Not enough revenue or traction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're not focused enough on climate. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They're not familiar enough with proptech / construction tech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our best conversations were with firms who:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Believe in B2B and are willing to invest in new markets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appreciate my background in VC and PE-backed startups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like data-as-a-service business models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fund that I was excited about turned us down because they were too close to the contractor data market. He spent years working at one of the big contractor marketplaces. When he declined to invest, he gave me the best advice: "You need to find an investor who is as irrationally excited about this idea as you are." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This advice stuck with me, and I remained optimistic that I would find some irrationally excited funds and angel investors. And that's what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll announce who they are once we're signed, sealed, and delivered 😁.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Lessons from my many customer interviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there's one piece of startup advice that I hear over and over again, it's this: interview customers from day 1... and never stop. I have taken this to heart. I have customer calls nearly every day. Usually multiple. I have learned A LOT. Here are some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like investors, the best meetings come from referrals. I get a call nearly every time someone we both know introduces me. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cold emailing is getting a lot harder. When it works, it works well, but it's a numbers game, and I have to get lucky. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proptech customers have many uses for clean and processed permit data. Their needs are unique, but our delivery is the same. They all want to store this data internally. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many would pay a premium for weekly or daily permit data refreshes rather than monthly updates. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Construction banks can use our processed data for underwriting and loan draw decisions, but they need broad coverage to see the value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've given quotes ranging from $500/mo to $10,000/mo. I love that. Our geographic coverage is the only thing keeping me from closing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Asks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're hiring! We'd appreciate any candidate intros. Feel free to share these job descriptions: &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Intros to construction loan people. I want more interviews. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intros to developers who do 10+ projects at a time in the Bay Area. I need to learn more from this segment. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next note will officially announce our funding round, and then probably we'll settle into a quarterly update to all of you friends and/or family and/or investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greetings!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the special fundraising update email and other updates since last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have raised $610,000 so far, with more likely to come in the next few weeks! (Timing likely will be delayed by the Silicon Valley Bank failure and related malaise.) This money is in the bank, so it's official.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm still taking a few very strategic fundraising calls. We don't need more money, but I'm receptive to any investors who could help us find product-market fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of product-market fit, that's top of mind now and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Expect this to be the central topic of these newsletters going forward!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And to that end, I completely rewrote &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/"&gt;our website&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago. It still needs some color, but I'm happy with the copy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We released a &lt;a href="https://shovels.retool.com/embedded/public/e440a465-a280-44be-aa81-5388b8ac20ff"&gt;Green Contractor Directory&lt;/a&gt; prototype!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fundraise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pleased to share that our lead investor is Zach Coelius from &lt;a href="https://coelius.vc/"&gt;Coelius Capital&lt;/a&gt;. He's an ideal lead for us. I've known of Zach for years. We've been in the same circles but didn't really connect until late last year after I attended one of his dinners in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zach knows the super early stages as well as anybody. He'll be a great sounding board as we come up against critical decisions and can help us raise funds to accelerate growth if needed. We're delighted to have his support!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other angel investors, whom I won't name directly but can describe as old friends, new friends, former bosses, and fans of my personal blog, were the first to sign and send their checks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luka and I are humbled and grateful -- and ready to get back to work :) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Direction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continue to learn. The permit and contractor data landscape is evolving rapidly, and we are a player in this space. The other companies are aware of us and reacting to our presence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I'm good at, perhaps because I enjoy doing it, is getting to know my neighbors. I like to be friendly with my business neighbors, too. I want to know everyone in the market. Not just know their names, but meet them, exchange messages, and (try to) be friends. It doesn't always work, but when it does, it leads to profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses that look like competitors can turn out to be partners, customers, or lead to friendly mergers. This has happened at every company I've run. It happened again recently with Shovels. I'm really happy about this development because it opens up a big opportunity for us in the contractor data market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contractor data is what I said we'd do in the early days of Shovels. Late last year, though, I became very excited about permit data. I saw a huge opportunity there. I still see it. I'd reach out or be introduced to potential customers under the pretense of contractor data and discover that what they really wanted was permits. It's a huge opportunity, but I don't think it's ours to get. We don't have enough value to add there; the incumbents will meet this need well and soon enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contractor data is a different story. It's underserved, and we have a tremendous opportunity right now to fill the void. I describe the four segments on &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/"&gt;our website&lt;/a&gt;: software, climate, finance, and builders. I'll write more detail about all four in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coming Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a very exciting product roadmap! We're going to expand our little &lt;a href="https://shovels.retool.com/embedded/public/e440a465-a280-44be-aa81-5388b8ac20ff"&gt;green contractor prototype&lt;/a&gt;. We're going to make all of the San Francisco Bay Area available; this demo currently has only 500 records.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to release an API (application programming interface -- a way for computer programmers to easily access this data) and put contractor landing pages up on our website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next quarter, we're going to layer on additional datasets to make the contractor information even more insightful. I'll share more details on these data layers soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, we're going deep on contractor data and we're starting in the SF Bay Area. I'll share more next month when more products are released! &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category></entry><entry><title>April 2023 Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/april-2023-newsletter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-04-20T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-04-20T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-04-20:/blog/april-2023-newsletter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We've raised over $960,000 in our successful fundraising journey, thanks to amazing investor support.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few more updates since last time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have now raised $960,000, up from $610,000 last month. We're very grateful for the investor support and ready to prove that customers are equally excited about what we're building. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have more detail on the ICPs (ideal customer profiles) we're targeting. The picture continues to get clearer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're also excited about AI/GPT/LLMs, etc. I'll share a couple of snippets about how we're using this latest (justifiably) hyped up technology. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new data is coming, and we have plans to go national. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundraise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're very pleased to add &lt;a href="https://www.coolclimatecollective.com/"&gt;Cool Climate Collective&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://venture.angellist.com/zach-coelius/syndicate"&gt;Coelius Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.coolclimatecollective.com/"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.manaventures.vc/"&gt;Mana Ventures&lt;/a&gt; to our list of investors. We also added another friendly angel. We'll close this seed round at just over $1M, punt any new interest to the next round, and focus 100% on execution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We still do customer interviews every day. It's incredibly helpful. Although I'm eager to actually close deals, since it's taken longer to process the data we've acquired than we originally anticipated, I'm able to have more wide-ranging conversations. I'm not held back by what we have in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm learning that there are all sorts of problems that can be addressed with permit data. We can go very deep into pre-construction timelines, serving information about approval steps, costs, and timing. My focus previously was on construction, what happens once the permit is approved. There's a whole other world of pre-construction data going back to when a permit is submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serving this market will require going deeper into planning departments, requesting data from public utilities, and even scanning planning commission minutes and agendas. We can't do all of this tomorrow, but it feels well within the scope of Shovels to tackle it eventually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, our latest ICPs look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Construction loan portfolio manager at a bank&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem&lt;/em&gt;: Limited information about contractor quality when asked to underwrite a new loan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shovels Solution&lt;/em&gt;: Contractor metrics and permits summary delivered as a PDF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Construction loan fund controller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem&lt;/em&gt;: No idea what else a contractor is working on when they're asked to approve a loan draw&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shovels Solutions&lt;/em&gt;: Current and past contractor metrics and permits history delivered as JSON via API, and webhooks for permit processing time changes in a set of jurisdictions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Large condo developer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem&lt;/em&gt;: No visibility into pre-construction permit timelines in a given jurisdiction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shovels Solution&lt;/em&gt;: Web app interface to look up detailed permit and planning approval timelines in different cities and counties&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Proptech CEO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem&lt;/em&gt;: No programmatic way to see if a house has an active permit already&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shovels Solution&lt;/em&gt;: Permits delivered on a given address via API&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of you fall into these buckets. If you want to chat, please get in touch! You know I like a good brainstorm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As these ideas firm up further, I'll incorporate them "officially" into our website copy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All the AI stuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll admit it -- I registered shovels.ai because it was the only decent "shovels" domain available. But I'm sure glad we got it! I had no idea AI was going to blow up like this in the months following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual AI application here is pretty obvious. Permits come with a lot of data and not all of it is structured. The AI models do a fantastic job of quickly (meaning: without any contextual training) identifying what the permit is about (meaning: categorizing it). That's just out of the box. We can train AI models to get better over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are front-end uses too. You could imagine asking a chat-like interface about permits on a property, permits performed by a contractor, or who should remodel your kitchen. A lot of people would be excited about this, and we have a role to play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going national&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're working out a way for us to expand nationally very quickly. It's a direct result of the ICP discussions I've had recently: geographically-constrained data isn't nearly as valuable as national scope. It's a tricky dance but we're making headway and working towards a deal. I hope to be able to announce it next month! &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category></entry><entry><title>May 2023 Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/may-2023-newsletter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-05-24T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-05-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-05-24:/blog/may-2023-newsletter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our final fundraising total reached an impressive $1,071,939.39. We are grateful for the interest and support we received during this process. We also expanded our team by hiring a full-time data engineer and two talented summer interns. One of our interns developed a chat AI interface for our Shovels API, which will be incorporated into our upcoming website. Additionally, we have been actively considering building and zoning laws and are excited about the potential opportunities they present. On another note, we are thrilled to announce that national data coverage is just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Shovels May 2023 Newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few more updates since April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our final fundraising total is $1,071,939.39. I'm happy to connect with any additional interest but we'll ultimately push it to the next round. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We hired a full-time data engineer and two summer interns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of our interns made a chat AI interface to the &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference"&gt;Shovels API&lt;/a&gt;. We're going to incorporate it into a new website we're building this summer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're thinking a lot about building and zoning laws. Aren't you?  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National data coverage is right around the corner. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fundraise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a wrap! We set out to to raise $1M, pared it back to $500K, then raised the target to $750K and then back again to $1M. Fundraising is hard. It was hard for us too, but I think we did a few things right and caught a bit of good fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll share a few learnings here about the fundraising process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was told by a climate tech CEO who recently raised several million dollars that I should expect to pitch 100 VCs. She generously shared her VC list with me. I ended up pitching about 20 before finding a lead investor, and then about 20 more to fill out the round to $1M.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing beats customer interviews. I didn't know this at the time, but I refined my investor pitch each time I spoke to a prospect interested in building permit data. It helped me choose the right language, define the right need, and formulate a solution that makes sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What makes sense to customers also makes sense to investors. It makes sense that these pitches should be quite similar. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It helps to be unique. Investors don't hear a lot of pitches about building permit data, so Shovels doesn't sound like anything else. I can use that to capture their imaginations, and I've learned from customer interviews about the many uses that permit data can have in the pre- and post-construction phases. I can make Shovels sound big &lt;em&gt;because it's true&lt;/em&gt;. This can be a VERY big business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investors and customers love the Shovels brand. We lucked into that bit of inspiration (the first domain I bought for this project was ChooseAGC -- "choose a general contractor" -- not nearly as cool). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And we got lucky that our lead investor bought in right away and has stood by us the rest of the fundraising journey.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operating Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to share a bit of high-level strategy about how we operate Shovels, which also worked well when fundraising. For anyone who knows me and reads my stuff, this strategy below should not be surprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two central operating principles in our 2023 budget:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get to breakeven as quickly as possible. This means staying lean for as long as possible and offsetting expenses with related revenue wherever possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convert investment into ARR. This ensures a good return for investors as well as founders. It’s &lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; equity we’re selling, after all! If we raise $1M, we want to be at a $1M annual revenue run rate when we start fundraising the next round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these principles in mind, our financial projections are modeled with the following results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Total burn of about $500K. We want to spend no more than half of funds raised before reaching breakeven, so we’ll still have powder left for growth experiments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peak burn of about $70K/mo. High fixed costs are salaries and data acquisition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will be at breakeven by summer 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the assumptions built into this model are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can limit churn to 1% per month and upsell at 0.5% per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luka can get by with 1 data engineer to breakeven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ryan can get by with 2 junior sales or 1 senior sales person to breakeven&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our ACV is at least $1,000/mo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our product works and excites our customers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can reach profitability by selling just our API products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to leverage my background with Xenon Partners to execute on revenue while being sensitive to cash flow by utilizing SEO and high impact content on target social media networks for market development. I also expect that our product will be great and we’ll continue to get word-of-mouth referrals because my co-founder is a badass CTO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most investors liked, if not &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt;, this message. The ones that weren't impressed, I wouldn't want to work with anyway. It's an important filter for me so I was very open about it. Plus, it's true. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did hire two summer interns. Luka got his data engineer (Petra is fantastic!) and I'm still experimenting with some sales strategies before hiring anyone full-time. In sum these are not insignificant expenses, but I can justify them 100% knowing that everyone at Shovels is working towards one goal right now: &lt;strong&gt;get revenue as fast as possible&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More thinking about AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing from last month's newsletter, I have a few updates to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This summer we're looking at all the large language model (LLM) options and figuring out the right tech stack to use to process millions of permit records through it for permit classification and entity extraction (appliances, rooms, quantities, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We found another niche in municipal building and planning codes. Someone (might as well be us!) needs to load them into a LLM and use the LLM to figure out what the building rules are: setbacks, height limits, density requirements. These rules can completely disrupt the economics of a large project and they're very difficult to find and update. AI to the rescue! I know we're not the only ones with our eyes on this problem. Solving it is a stretch goal for the summer. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In general, I see good data as our competitive advantage in the coming AI wars. Try asking Bard or ChatGPT what permits have been issued in a given zip code. They can't do it, but we can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going national&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We signed a deal today to get national data starting on June 1. We're working overtime to prep the data pipelines for this influx of data and we'll start reaching out to those of you who have been asking for this for months. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category></entry><entry><title>Go-to-market strategies for proptech companies</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/go-to-market-strategies-for-proptech-companies/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-22T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-06-22T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-06-22:/blog/go-to-market-strategies-for-proptech-companies/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shovels can help you create an effective go-to-market plan that will ensure your message is heard loud and clear.

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding the proptech landscape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proptech, or property technology, is revolutionizing the real estate industry. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as big data, cloud computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI), proptech companies are creating innovative products and services that are transforming how people live and work with an emphasis on property data. In this section, we will discuss what proptech is and its different categories, the impact of proptech on the real estate industry, highlight some of the most successful proptech companies and their strategies, and share examples of how proptech is transforming how people live and work with an emphasis on property data including building permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, proptech consists of software solutions developed to improve efficiency in real estate transactions. It can be divided into three categories; product/service innovation – aimed at improving customer experiences; process automation – aimed at streamlining internal processes; and data-driven analytics – focused on gaining insights from a large amount of data to improve operations. These categories are helping to drive efficiency in both residential and commercial markets across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of proptech has been far-reaching in the real estate industry. From streamlining processes for tenants to providing more detailed insights into market trends for buyers - these technological solutions have enabled businesses to make better decisions faster than ever before. Additionally, they have allowed them to provide their customers with a better experience by utilizing tools such as virtual reality tours or digital payment options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most successful proptech companies include &lt;a href="https://www.zillow.com/"&gt;Zillow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.wework.com/"&gt;WeWork&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.compass.com/"&gt;Compass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.redfin.com/"&gt;Redfin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.opendoor.com/"&gt;OpenDoor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.divvyhomes.com/"&gt;Divvy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.reonomy.com/"&gt;Reonomy&lt;/a&gt; to name a few. Each company has its own unique strategy for success but all have leveraged technology to create products that make it easier for consumers to access information about properties or facilitate transactions quickly and conveniently online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing convenience for consumers searching for properties or looking to close a transaction quickly, proptech solutions like building permits also benefit businesses by giving them access to up-to-date information about local regulations quickly so they can avoid compliance issues or costly delays during development projects. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.accela.com/"&gt;Accela's&lt;/a&gt; govtech permit module enables users to easily search for permits within their city or county in order to view detailed information about each permit including who applied for it when it was filed and when it was granted or denied. This not only saves time but also helps developers stay informed about local rules while planning new projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, proptech offers tremendous potential both for consumers who are looking for more convenient ways of accessing information about properties or closing a transaction quickly, as well as businesses who need access up -to -date information quickly in order stay compliant with local regulations while planning projects. By leveraging these technologies, proptech companies can create effective go-to-market strategies that will help them reach their target audiences effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Developing target audience personas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing target audience personas is an important step for proptech companies to reach their customers. Personas define the characteristics of a customer segment, allowing businesses to create marketing strategies that are tailored to the specific needs and desires of that group. By understanding their target audience, proptech companies can craft effective messaging that resonates with them and helps them achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing target audience personas should be done during the planning phase of any go-to-market strategy as it will inform all subsequent decisions about how best to reach those customers. It’s also important for a proptech company to analyze customer behavior in order to determine what types of messaging they respond most positively towards. For example, understanding which channels they use most frequently and what types of content they consume can help inform which methods would be most effective for reaching them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building permits are another key tool for understanding when a persona is in the market for a proptech purchase. Building permits offer insight into when people are ready or likely to invest in property technology products or services such as automated home energy monitors, smart security systems, or heat pump HVAC systems. By leveraging this data, businesses can customize their go-to-market plan accordingly and ensure that their message reaches potential customers at the right time with maximum impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking these steps, proptech companies can create effective marketing strategies tailored towards their desired audiences that will help them maximize success and reach their goals. Developing comprehensive target audience personas is key for any business looking to make an impact with its go-to-market strategy, and especially so for those operating within the ever-evolving proptech landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating a go-to-market plan using building permits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a go-to-market plan using building permits is an important step for just about every proptech company. Building permits are documents that allow businesses to carry out construction or renovation projects, and they provide valuable information on who the target market is for a particular proptech product or service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two main types of building permits: residential and commercial. Residential building permits refer to those issued for homes, such as single-family residences or duplexes, while commercial building permits refer to those issued for large-scale projects, such as multi-family dwellings or retail stores. Understanding these permit types can help proptech companies determine which types of customers will benefit most from their products or services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if a proptech company is offering a smart home energy management system, they might look for recently approved residential building permits in order to identify potential buyers who would be interested in the product. On the other hand, if the proptech company offers a cloud-based property management system suitable for large buildings with multiple tenants, then they may look at recently approved commercial building permits in order to find potential customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there's a tool available that makes it easier to quickly find homeowners and contractors who have recently submitted or completed a building permit: Shovels. With Shovels, proptech companies can use advanced search tools and filters to narrow down potential customers based on criteria such as location and type of project (residential vs. commercial). This allows them to create targeted marketing strategies tailored specifically towards their target audiences more efficiently than traditional methods like cold calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging the right technologies like Shovels and understanding how building permits work as part of their go-to-market strategy, proptech companies can reach their target customers more effectively and maximize their success in this rapidly growing industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choosing the right technologies for your proptech company&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing the right technologies for your proptech company is essential for reaching out to your target audiences and maximizing success. The technologies you choose should be tailored to the needs of your business, so it’s important to take the time to research what’s available and understand how they can work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most effective ways to reach out to potential customers is through direct mail. &lt;a href="https://www.lob.com/"&gt;Lob&lt;/a&gt; is a valuable tool for proptech companies, as it allows them to send out direct mail pieces with a home address on them. This helps build trust between potential customers and your brand, as it shows that you’re willing to put in the extra effort when communicating with them, especially when using building permits to reach out at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way of reaching out via phone or email is by using a homeowner phone and email database. These databases allow you to access contact information for potential customers, allowing you to connect directly with personalized messages that speak to their specific projects. You can also use these databases to track customer behavior over time, giving you a better understanding of who your target audience is and how best to reach them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, hiring a software consultant or using your engineering team can help stitch APIs together and automate processes such as data collection and analysis. This means that all the data collected from different sources will be automatically compiled into one place, allowing you to make more informed decisions about which technologies are best suited for your business goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By selecting the right technologies for your proptech company, you can create an effective go-to-market strategy that will help you reach your target audiences and maximize success in this rapidly growing industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Measuring and optimizing your go-to-market success&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measuring and optimizing your go-to-market success is essential for proptech companies that want to maximize their return on investment. Proptech companies can use a variety of strategies to measure and optimize their success, such as regularly analyzing data, conducting A/B tests, and taking customer feedback into account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing data regularly is one of the most important strategies for measuring and optimizing your go-to-market success. By looking at data trends over time, proptech companies can better understand how their marketing efforts are performing in terms of website visits, conversions, customer satisfaction scores, etc., as well as identify any potential issues or anomalies. This allows them to make informed decisions about how to tweak campaigns or products in order to maximize performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A/B testing is another powerful tool that proptech companies can use to measure the effectiveness of changes they have made to their marketing efforts. A/B testing involves creating two versions of a piece of content (e.g., an email) and then testing both versions on different audiences in order to determine which one performs better. This technique enables proptech companies to experiment with different approaches without having to guess what will work best for their target customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, taking customer feedback into account is essential when it comes to measuring and optimizing your go-to-market success. By asking customers questions about their experience with your product or service after they’ve used it, you can gain valuable insights into what works and what doesn’t work from a user’s perspective – information which you can then use to improve campaigns or products accordingly. In addition, using surveys or focus groups provides another way for proptech companies to gain insights into what would improve the customer experience and increase engagement rates with their offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging the right technologies and following these strategies for measuring and optimizing your go-to-market success, proptech companies can ensure that they reach the right audiences with the right message at the right time - helping them maximize their return on investment in this rapidly growing industry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="GTM"></category><category term="gtm"></category><category term="building permits"></category></entry><entry><title>June 2023 Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/june-2023-newsletter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-06-28T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-06-28T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-06-28:/blog/june-2023-newsletter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Enough with the fundraising blah blah blah.

In addition, we've identified some really interesting go-to-market (GTM) uses for building permits.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Shovels June 2023 Newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough with the fundraising blah blah blah. It's time to start talking about building permits! Here's the quick newsletter summary: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are cranking through 100 million building permits and doing all the things: cleaning, normalizing, fixing, and scrubbing so you can &lt;em&gt;get great data.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Order of release will be California, Florida, Texas, and New York. I'll announce the next tranche in a month. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are some really interesting go-to-market (GTM) uses for building permits. I'll name a few. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early-bird pricing will be available in the next newsletter. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are burning up the servers at AWS! Amazon has granted multiple requests to increase our &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/"&gt;Fargate&lt;/a&gt; limits. That's how cool we are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processing all of this data is not without its challenges. While I hoped we'd have all of California launched already, we're doggone close, and I know you're going to love what we deliver. Here are a few of the things you can look forward to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permits in over 200 jurisdictions&lt;/strong&gt;. The Golden State LOVES local permitting. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building electrification tagging&lt;/strong&gt;. We've identified all the permits related to batteries, heat pumps, EV chargers, and solar panels. We 💚 the 🌎 too. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contractor rollups&lt;/strong&gt;. All these permits and tags roll up to contractors so you can see who's doing how much of what type of work. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normalized addresses&lt;/strong&gt;. The lovely people who enter permits into databases do all sorts of funny things with addresses, making us 🥺. So we fixed them for you.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man, we are so close to launch. Soo close! We'll send a quick newsletter out when it's done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things to do with permits: GTM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people come through our marketing funnel, I always ask them what they plan to do with Shovels data. The uses are varied, but there's been an increasingly common use case: go-to-market (GTM). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes sense! Building permits are a gold mine for both B2B and B2C buyer intent. For B2B, a submitted commercial building permit means that the builder is in purchasing mode. Construction tech companies should get on it! Building entry systems, HVAC components, project management software... the roof's the limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For B2C, a recently completed residential permit is a prime target for property tech companies. That homeowner is now ready to fix the lawn that just got torn up, install a new driveway, or put up solar panels. We can filter for EV chargers and batteries so climate tech companies can reach out about cost-cutting software add-ons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote more detail about all of this in our latest blog post: &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/go-to-market-strategies-for-proptech-companies/"&gt;Go-to-market strategies for proptech companies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pricing update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still figuring it out, but I'm certain that we will offer a low-volume plan and special unlimited volume pricing for CA, FL, TX and NY once it's loaded. In the future, we'll offer pricing tiers for historical data and enhanced permit details. For our earliest customers, though, we'll throw it all in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll let you know when you can get in on this Shovels API pricing bonanza. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category></entry><entry><title>Go-to-market strategies for contech companies</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/go-to-market-strategies-for-contech-companies/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-10T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-07-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-07-10:/blog/go-to-market-strategies-for-contech-companies/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Grow your contech startup with this comprehensive guide to go-to-market strategies, covering topics such as identifying target markets, developing an effective plan, and leveraging building permits to identify potential customers.

&lt;h2&gt;Overview of contech and go-to-market strategies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go-to-market strategies are essential for construction technology (contech) companies to succeed in the competitive market. To reach their goals and grow their business, contech companies must have an effective go-to-market strategy that is tailored to the needs of their target customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing and executing an effective go-to-market strategy can be challenging. It requires careful planning, market research, and dedication. To ensure success, contech companies need to identify target markets, develop a plan of action with specific goals and objectives, leverage building permits to identify potential customers, create a marketing plan for reaching those customers, track performance metrics, and finally measure customer sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful go-to-market plan for contech companies should include several key components. First, it should clearly define the target audience and outline the customer journey from awareness through purchase. Additionally, it should include an analysis of competitive offerings in the same space as well as strategies for achieving a competitive advantage in the market. Finally, it should demonstrate how the company will monitor its progress towards its goals and objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say you are a contech startup with a few million dollars in VC funding. The rest of this blog post is about how you can create your go-to-market strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Identifying your target market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying your target market is an integral part of any successful go-to-market plan. Knowing who you are targeting, and understanding their needs, preferences, and behaviors allows you to craft a marketing message that will resonate with them and drive conversions. Here are some key steps that you should take when identifying your target market:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define and segment the target market: Start by defining the primary demographic characteristics for your ideal customer base – age, gender, income level, education level, etc. Then segment this broader group into distinct subgroups based on psychographic characteristics such as lifestyle and interests as well as geographic criteria like location or climate. This is basic Marketing 101 stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research the needs of the target market: Once you have identified your target market segments, it's time to conduct research to understand what drives them. This could include surveying customers about their preferences or using data from online search behavior to identify what topics they are interested in learning more about. This research will help you define your message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Map out the customer journey: By understanding how customers interact with products or services throughout their journey (awareness stage through purchase), you can identify areas where they may be experiencing pain points that need solutions. Analyzing competitor activity can also provide insights into potential customer behavior so you can better customize your go-to-market strategies accordingly. Knowing if your target customers already use a competing product and what they think about that product can yield powerful insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use primary and secondary research methods: Primary research involves gathering information directly from customers through surveys or interviews while secondary research involves collecting existing data from sources such as industry reports or government statistics databases. Both types of research are important when it comes to developing an accurate picture of the target market so you can effectively tailor your go-to-market approach for maximum success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking these steps to identify and understand their target market, you can create a successful go-to-market plan tailored to meet your unique goals and objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Developing an effective go-to-market plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some key steps to help you create a successful go-to-market plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Align the strategy with your company's mission and objectives: Your strategy should clearly define what you are trying to achieve and how you will accomplish your goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a timeline for implementation: A timeline helps make sure that tasks are completed on time, resources are allocated efficiently, and goals are met on schedule. Timelines also keep you organized in case something unexpected arises or needs adjustment along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline necessary resources: Developing an effective go-to-market plan requires having access to the right resources. These may include personnel, marketing materials, customer service support teams, technical assistance, and budget for data acquisition, depending upon your plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track progress &amp;amp; adjust as necessary: As you implement your go-to-market strategy, it's important to track progress against set objectives throughout the process so that you can make any needed adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Leveraging building permits to identify players in your target market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraging building permits to identify players in your target market can be a very powerful tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building permit data is an invaluable resource for understanding the competitive landscape and identifying potential customers that may need contech services or products. By using this data, you can gain valuable insights into your target market and use that information to better inform your go-to-market strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different types of building permits that can provide you with useful insight into your target market. Residential building permits give you a better understanding of the homeowners who might need your services, while commercial building permits provide information about businesses in the area that may benefit from your products. Additionally, local and state ordinances can give you insight into zoning regulations and other rules that could affect the success of your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To leverage building permits for market research purposes, first look up what types of permits are available in your area, then search for those specific permit types in Shovels to get additional details about any applicable property or project. Shovels will produce lists of addresses and the contractors working on those projects. Both the building owner and the contractor can be prospective customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also track changes in permit activity over time to see if there has been any recent growth or decline in your target geographical markets. By tracking these changes, you can adjust your strategies accordingly and take advantage of new opportunities as they arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By leveraging building permit data to identify players in your target market, you can gain valuable insight into the competitive landscape and develop an effective go-to-market strategy tailored specifically to your own unique circumstances. Building permits are the ultimate buyer signal for contech go-to-market planning.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="GTM"></category><category term="gtm"></category><category term="building permits"></category></entry><entry><title>The growth of EV chargers in California</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/growth-of-ev-charging-in-california/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-24T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-07-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-07-24:/blog/growth-of-ev-charging-in-california/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At Shovels, we provide developers with access to monthly EV charger installation data through our building permit API. This data reveals the tremendous growth and geographic distribution of EV charging infrastructure, with insights into the locations and companies involved. Understanding this data is crucial for businesses, developers, and governments to identify areas for expansion and to make informed decisions. With our API, developers can accurately map existing charger locations, analyze infrastructure, and even predict future demand for electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As the world embraces green energy solutions, electric vehicles (EVs) have become increasingly popular. This surge in EV adoption has driven a rapid expansion of the EV charging infrastructure – and now developers can use our &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference"&gt;building permit API&lt;/a&gt; to access monthly EV charger installation data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our EV charger permit data shows tremendous growth of EV charging infrastructure. We see where it's happening and who's doing the installations. To learn more about how to access this valuable data, check out our API documentation at https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview of EV charging infrastructure expansion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California's EV charging infrastructure is experiencing unprecedented growth as demand for electric vehicles continues to grow. Government policies, such as subsidies and tax incentives, which have created a favorable environment for the growth of the EV market have driven this surge in EV adoption. In addition, technology advancements have lowered the cost of EV charging systems, allowing consumers to easily charge electric vehicles at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, many cities have introduced curbside chargers that allow users to charge their cars while they are parked on the street or in parking garages. New public chargers are added daily across the country. Businesses and organizations are also making significant investments in EV infrastructure. Private companies are building large-scale networks of high-powered chargers that can charge multiple cars at once. These networks can be found in airports, shopping centers, and other areas with high traffic. Additionally, many municipalities are investing heavily in public charger networks, making it easier than ever before to find a charger when you need one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These advancements in technology and policy initiatives have helped create an incredibly robust and rapidly growing EV charging infrastructure that is helping drive consumer adoption of EVs worldwide. Developers are now able to access detailed EV charger installation data through the Shovels API. We share historical trends and the exact places and companies who carried out the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gathering and analyzing EV charger data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gathering and analyzing EV charger data is essential for businesses, developers, and governments to understand the current state of the EV charging market and identify areas where it needs to be expanded. With the right tools, developers can accurately map out existing EV charger locations and explore geographic distribution of charger networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geographic information systems (GIS) are powerful tools that enable developers to map out EV charger locations based on their lat/long coordinates or addresses. GIS can also be used to analyze existing infrastructure to identify areas with high demand for additional charging stations. Companies can use Shovels data to see residential EV charger activity, which could inform the location for commercial charging stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For utilities, this data will be helpful to perform stress test modeling on the electrical grid. For states that have put in place GHG reduction goals, understanding consumer adoption of EV chargers will provide more support for transitioning power sources to solar, wind, and other renewables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="EV Charger chart" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/shovels_ev_prediction.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Insights from our EV charger permit dataset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By examining the EV charger data contained in our building permit API, we can gain a new level of insight into the expansion of EV charging infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rbucks/monthly-ev-charger-permits"&gt;public link to this dataset on Kaggle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) for the number of EV charger permits in California from 2012 to 2022 is approximately 38.76%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on monthly EV data going back to 2012, we predict California will see about 11,000 EV permits in 2023, roughly 40% more than 2022, and 13,000 EV permits in 2024, another 20% jump.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seasonality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It appears that the months of August, October, and September have the highest average number of permits. Here are those monthly averages between 2012 and 2022:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January: 184.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;February: 150.91&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March: 186.91&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;April: 192.64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;May: 201.73&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;June: 211.18&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;July: 203.18&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;August: 239.64&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;September: 236.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October: 240.55&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;November: 214.45&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December: 229.00&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's worth noting that the number of permits also seems to be lower in the beginning of the year and tends to increase as the year progresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of permits issued each month varies significantly, indicating the presence of considerable volatility in the data. This could be due to various factors such as changes in governmental policies, market demand, technological advancements, and other external factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just one slice of our permit data. We also offer a comprehensive overview of current and future trends in all energy transition activities, including heat pumps and solar installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to access building permit data with Shovels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessing building permit data is essential for developers, businesses, government, and researchers who want to understand the current state of energy transition infrastructure and identify areas where it needs expansion. To make this process easier, we have a building permit API that enables our customers to query building permits by the type of work involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you can query for wall battery permits, heat pump HVAC conversions, solar panel installations, and EV charger networks. The data returned from these queries can be used for construction go-to-market activities, providing highly targeted leads for sales teams. Developers can also use this data to create applications related to energy transition activities, such as mapping out EV charger locations or predicting future demand for electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how you can use the Shovels building permit API to access monthly energy transition activity data and build applications related to this area, check out our documentation at &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference"&gt;https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Data"></category><category term="gtm"></category><category term="building permits"></category><category term="ev chargers"></category><category term="climate"></category></entry><entry><title>July 2023 Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/july-2023-newsletter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-07-24T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-07-24T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-07-24:/blog/july-2023-newsletter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We overcame data processing challenges and loaded all of California into our internal database, with an API update coming soon. Additionally, we are actively following up with Florida, Texas, and New York, and we remain on track to expand nationwide by the end of summer. We have also created a dashboard showcasing building electrification permits in Contra Costa County and made predictions for EV charging permits in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Greetings!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm writing from Sunriver, OR, where my family's vacation ground to a halt due to air quality. There's a wildfire in Oregon. Several, actually, but the one that's bothering me right now is smoldering 75 miles to the west, and it smells like the inside of a chimney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In happier news: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We finally broke through a bunch of data processing hurdles to load up all of California into our internal database. The API update is imminent! We now show 21M building permits in California, where the air is perfect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're still following up with Florida, Texas, and New York. We'll know more about going nationwide after this, but I'm confident that we'll get there by the end of summer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our really smart friend made a cool dashboard of building electrification permits in Contra Costa County. We also tried to predict the number of EV charging permits in 2024. Links to both are below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Early-bird pricing is here. How does $1K/mo for unlimited access through 2023 sound?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Processing update&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full API data load is just days away. We want this next release to be pretty much perfect! With that in mind, we made these improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleared out all the "nan" and "null" values in the API results &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplified our tag list and made sure that each one has permits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further improved our address matching (this one was tricky!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sped up the overall processing time by using more efficient data structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few cool statistics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Californians file about 100,000 building permits each month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LA and Orange Counties make up a third of all historical CA building permits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LA, San Diego, Riverside, and Orange Counties have a third of all &lt;em&gt;solar&lt;/em&gt; permits 🌞&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LA and Sacramento Counties (finally, some NorCal representation) are the leaders in EV charging ⚡️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2022, LA County filed the most ADU permits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also in 2022, Riverside County led in new homes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminder: you can get all of this detail (the individual addresses and contractors) using our API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: Charts and dashboards&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should not be surprising that there's a lot of interest in building permits for home electrification. We're seeing this interest from climate tech companies, financial institutions, and even the public sector. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking the progress of residential EV chargers is important for transportation authorities who need to plan for public EV charging stations. Communities that have more residential chargers will have less demand for public ones, so those resources can go elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahidaniels/"&gt;Sarah Daniels&lt;/a&gt; made &lt;a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sarah.daniels4671/viz/CCCTestdashv1/Dashboard1#1"&gt;this amazing dashboard&lt;/a&gt; of building electrification permits in Contra Costa County using Shovels data. If you see a need for something like this in your own community, please let us know! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also put on our data science hats and built a prediction model for EV charger permits in CA through 2024. Predictions are the dotted line. We even decided to write a &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/growth-of-ev-charging-in-california/"&gt;blog post about it&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've been having a bunch of conversations about what all this Shovels data is going to cost. The short answer is this: we still don't know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have a solution! Early-bird pricing that you can lock in now and keep for the rest of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

Our analysis reveals significant variations in approval times across different jurisdictions in the state. While some jurisdictions in Northern California have remarkably fast approval times, many Southern California jurisdictions experience delays of up to two months. Streamlining the permitting process could be a key factor in improving EV charger installation rates. Interestingly, we found no correlation between the volume of permits processed and approval times, suggesting that bureaucratic overload is not the primary cause of delays. This research provides valuable insights for policymakers, businesses, and homeowners looking to navigate the complex landscape of EV charger installations and contribute to the transition to cleaner, more sustainable transportation options.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Background on EV charging in California&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with our thinking about EV chargers, which you can &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/growth-of-ev-charging-in-california/"&gt;read more about here&lt;/a&gt;, we're turning our attention now to how long it takes for jurisdictions to approve EV charger permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let's take a step back. This analysis is important because California has committed to deploying five million zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) and building out 250,000 charging stations by 2025. This includes building a network of nearly 20,000 Level 2 and DC fast EV charging stations across the state. Additionally, the state plans to invest $2.5 billion over the next five years to expand the EV charging infrastructure and provide incentives for drivers to purchase electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having more residential EV chargers would make it easier for California residents to own and use electric vehicles. This would also relieve the burden on public EV chargers. The more EV chargers we have in homes, the less strain on the public chargers required for people who live in multifamily housing and don't have a dedicated charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More residential EV chargers also creates more jobs and boost the economy. Installation and maintenance of these chargers increases demand for electricians, supporting many local businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potential for building permit reform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to get more EV chargers installed is to streamline the permitting process. EV chargers, because they are high-voltage, require a licensed electrician and a building permit to begin the installation, and an inspector must approve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this process can be cumbersome, building permits exist to ensure that construction projects adhere to local safety and building codes. This is important for protecting the public and ensuring that buildings are safe and structurally sound. Building permits also provide a way for local governments to track construction projects and collect fees to help fund public services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people advocate permitting reform because the current permitting process is overly burdensome, time consuming, and costly, leading to delays and inefficiencies. Permitting reform may reduce the time and cost of obtaining permits, and make it easier for businesses and homeowners to quickly obtain the necessary approvals to install appliances like EV chargers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, with that background, let's look at the data in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shovels analysis of EV charger permit approval times&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels collects and analyzes building permit data. Two data points that we consistently see are the file date, or when the permit was submitted to the jurisdiction, and the issue date, or when the jurisdiction approved the permit. At this point, work can begin, and we'll eventually see the final date, or when the work was completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file date and the issue date show how long it takes for a jurisdiction to process a permit. As anyone who has had work done knows, this can be an agonizing process. The longer the delay, the more likely your contractor will get busy or supply costs will increase. Homeowners and contractors both want faster permit approval times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, we set out to ask a few questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Differences between jurisdictions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jurisdiction comparison: Which jurisdictions have the fastest and slowest average EV permit approval times? How do they compare to each other?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are there differences in permit approval times between Northern and Southern California?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the jurisdictions with the SLOWEST EV median charger permit approval times. We go with the median because there are outliers in the data that will skew the mean. You can see this in the table below, which shows that the mean is greater than the median in each case. The standard deviation and IQR (interquartile range) also demonstrate the skew. Therefore, the median is our best way to compare jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's interesting that four of the five slowest permitting jurisdictions are in Southern California. The median approval times are at least two months. That's too long! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Worst EV charger permit times" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/top5.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking now at the FASTEST EV charger timing jurisdictions, we see median times of less than a week. Interstingly, all but one of the jurisdictions is in Northern California. Even the averages here are reasonable, coming in at less than a month in the top four, but jumping to nearly three months average in San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;2.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;14.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;San Diego County&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;89.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;89.07&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;119.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;118.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Best EV charger permit times" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/bottom5.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here again, we see the apparent impact of outliers. San Diego has a media approval time of five days, but an average of three months. A few crazy long wait times down there are pulling the average away from the median.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Histogram of San Diego EV charger permit approval times" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/sd-histogram.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because it was interesting, to further investigate this distinction between Northern California and Southern California, we made one more chart. It tells the story that emerged just by looking at the top 5 and bottom 5 jurisdictions: Northern California issues EV charger permits faster than Southern California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Northern CA vs Southern CA" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/norcal-v-socal.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fatness of the bottom of the candlestick shows the bottom and top quartile wait times. A smaller candle is better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Trends over time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How has the average EV permit approval time changed over the years for each jurisdiction? Are there any jurisdictions where the approval time is consistently getting faster or slower?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are there certain times of the year when EV permit approval times are generally faster or slower? This could indicate seasonal workload fluctuations in permit offices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, we looked for jurisdictions where permit approval times are getting worse and others where they are getting better. Bucking the NorCal/SoCal trend described above, we found that permit times are getting better in Riverside County and worse in Milpitas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Riverside County approval times by year" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/riverside-county.png"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Milpitas approval times by year" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/milpitas.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The permit counts by year for each county might give some clues as to what's going on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Riverside County and Milpitas EV charger permit counts by year" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/riverside-milpitas-count.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the looks of these three charts, we find that the number of EV charger permits in Riverside County skyrocketed during the pandemic, and the jurisdiction must have put some permit streamlining reforms in place because despite the higher volume, they kept the processing times down. This combination led to a precipitous drop in permit approval times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the COVID question was interesting, so we looked across the board and came up with this chart. The processing times actually improved after COVID. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Impact of COVID on permit approval times in California" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/covid.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The relationship between permit volume and approval times&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is there a correlation between the number of permits a jurisdiction processes and the speed of approval? In other words, do jurisdictions that process more EV permits tend to approve them faster or slower?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This result surprised us. We assume that bureaucratic government departments are easily overwhelmed. As the number of permit applications increases, we expect that approval times would get slower. In fact, there's no relationship between the volume of permits and the processing times across the jurisdictions in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Scatter of approval times and volumes" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/approval-times-scatter.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pearson correlation coefficient here is −0.0730. This value indicates a very weak negative relationship. In other words, there's actually a slight tendency for jurisdictions that process more EV permits to approve them a bit faster, but the relationship is weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew! That was a lot of information about EV charger approval times. It seems we're still just scratching the surface. If you want to do more analysis, &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/contact"&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;. We have lots of data. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Data"></category><category term="gtm"></category><category term="building permits"></category><category term="ev chargers"></category><category term="permit timeline"></category><category term="climate"></category></entry><entry><title>August 2023 Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/august-2023-newsletter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-08-17T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-08-17T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-08-17:/blog/august-2023-newsletter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shovels, the leading provider of building permit and contractor API services, is expanding to Florida and Texas, with plans to cover all 47 remaining states by end of summer. We recently added date filters to our API, allowing users to easily access the most relevant data. Our team has also resolved any issues related to displaying dates in the API response. We are developing a new website that will offer registration and API key services, as well as a data explorer portal. Looking ahead, we are working on new market endpoints for building permits, providing valuable insights into current and historical trends by zip code.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like California. I've lived here my whole life, and so have both of my parents and most of my grandparents. That's why when we launched Shovels, we started in California. Why wouldn't we? California is the best 😎.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we keep hearing that the home of the Grateful Dead and Clint Eastwood is just not enough. You want more, so by golly, you'll get more. We are launching Florida and Texas in just a few days. And soon after that... the remaining 47 🇺🇸!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what else is going on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We added date filters to the API and fixed some issues displaying dates in the API response 🎉&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're building out a brand new website on some brand new technology. It will allow us to quickly add registration and API key services, as well as a data explorer portal for you folks that prefer not to deal with API endpoints. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That $249/mo price is live. On this plan you get 1,000 lookups per month in any  one state (so long as it's California... for now :) A self-serve pricing page will go up soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;API update: Date filters!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dates are important! You might not care about the roofing permit from 10 years ago, but you definitely care about the one filed last week. Our new date filters allow you to hone in on precisely the data you care most about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also now default sort permits by date descending, so in all responses, when you see a list of permits, the most recent ones are first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is live already (as of about 12 hours ago!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To celebrate, we added two new demos: &lt;a href="https://shovels.retool.com/embedded/public/9ab4b347-6227-4ee3-8648-b1e0dc632e1b"&gt;Permit Directory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shovels.retool.com/embedded/public/e440a465-a280-44be-aa81-5388b8ac20ff"&gt;Contractor Directory&lt;/a&gt;. You have to add a zip code and both the start and end dates for the demos to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really want to test it out, you'll need an API key. Just reply and I'll get one for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sneak preview: &lt;strong&gt;markets&lt;/strong&gt;. We're starting to plan for a new set of markets endpoints that will tell you all sorts of interesting current and historical trends for building permits by zip code. This data will be fantastic for those who are trying to prioritize sales territories by identifying where certain types of building activity is happening.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: Calculate approval times&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On most of our permits we are able to see the file date and the issue date, which bookend the jurisdiction's permit processing period. In other words, we can see which jurisdictions are slow and which ones are quick to approve permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For building developers, this is really important information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we keep hearing from EV charger companies, we decided to continue on our investigation of this industry with a post on EV charger permit approval times in California. We looked at every EV charger permit over the last few years and tallied them up by jurisdiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's one insight: &lt;strong&gt;We learned that Oakland approves EV charger permits 30X faster than LA&lt;/strong&gt;. Crazy, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/ev-charger-permit-processing-times-in-california/"&gt;read more about it here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

We also updated our monthly API pricing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Greetings from Las Vegas. I'm on Day 5 and very happy to be heading home now. 😮‍💨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel proud today. The Shovels team, all three of us, had a very productive two weeks working together in-person. I'm going to share some highlights below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🚀 We processed 100M building permits! We can run custom SQL queries and export CSV files for residential and commercial buildings nationwide. 🚀&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;States currently available in the API: California, Texas, Florida, and New York. Now that the rest are processed, we'll begin loading them into the API too. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of API, we released our &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/Markets/operation/get_market_activity_by_zip_code_v1_markets_permits_zip_get"&gt;markets endpoint&lt;/a&gt;. We count current and historical building permit counts on all of our zip codes sliced by any of our tags. I'll describe an interesting application for this data below! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also released &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference"&gt;new prettier API docs&lt;/a&gt;. Why does this matter? I'll tell you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our pricing matrix is good to go. You'll know what cost to expect when you're ready to get on this building permit data bandwagon. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;100 million building permits&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know most people reading this newsletter aren't data nerds. I'm glad for that. I'm also glad that I'm surrounded by people who love thinking about and wrangling with data. Building permit data is particularly challenging because it uses data types that are prone to be inconsistent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, look at these addresses: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4203 Pearl Gate Drive, Las Vegas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4203 Pearl Gate, Las Vegas, NV 89133&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4203 Pearl Gate DR, 89133&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know these are all the same address. But you're human and you're an expert at deduction. How do you get machines, which aren't built for ambiguity, to know these addresses are the same? And then how do you get machines to fill in the missing address components? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just one of many, many fascinating (dare I say fun?) problems we solved on the road to 100 million permits. I'm so proud of this team for getting through it so quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because now we can do stuff like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="SQL Screenshot" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/sql.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's a screenshot of SQL. Yes, this is a marketing newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just want to make a point about what it means to "process" 100 million permits. It means we have them all in a standard taxonomy that allows us to look up the same info across states, counties, and cities and run complex filters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm showing here is a way to identify leads for solar installers. This query scans all 100 million building permits in about 3 seconds using inexpensive AWS technology. It's amazing what our team built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now it can be yours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: Learn about neighborhoods&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretend you're in the market for a new home (or if you really are in this market, don't pretend, and I'm sorry). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are interested in two homes in the same city. They're comparable in size, age, amenities, school district, and price. You'd be happy with either one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there's a critical difference lurking below surface. They're in different neighborhoods, and different neighborhoods act... differently. We can measure this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say one home is in a neighborhood with very little permit activity. The neighbors aren't maintaining, improving, or expanding their homes. They're not invested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other home is in a neighborhood bustling with solar installs, new ADUs, and kitchen remodels. The homeowners are doubling down on their purchases, in it for the long haul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which house would you prefer now? I know my answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a new way of looking at neighborhoods. I don't believe this data exists anywhere else. We want to help you get it out there! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Neighborhood improvement index" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/neighborhood-index.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a heat map at the zip code level in my neck of the woods (we could also do this block-by-block) showing relative investment in ADUs, kitchens, and other additions. The SQL query that drives it is pretty cool too, but I'll just leave you with the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Beautiful API documentation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first company I co-founded was &lt;a href="https://www.scripted.com/"&gt;Scripted&lt;/a&gt;. I'm a business guy, but I've always been fascinated by programming. I guess that's why I landed in tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on at Scripted, I found reasons to get my hands dirty in Ruby and Python. I committed code, reviewed pull requests, and sprinkled bits of "Ryansoft" like fairy dust throughout our repository. I also worked with a lot of APIs, and I got to see the impact first-hand of thoughtful design and helpful documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I admire companies like Stripe and Clearbit who make it easy for developers to use their products. I want Shovels to be the same. Fortunately, the competition in our market is pretty weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why we are going to make Shovels the most developer-friendly construction data API in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference"&gt;new API docs&lt;/a&gt; are searchable, have input and output samples, and a new page structure. Enjoy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Money talk&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, yes, we are going to charge money for all this awesomeness. Here's how it looks. &lt;/p&gt;

We take a look at two no-code solutions, Bubble and FlutterFlow, which we used to develop our minimal viable products for Aikito and Shovels.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/The-Tea-on-Bubble-e29s4k0/a-aadirrd" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web development has witnessed a remarkable transformation, thanks in large part to the advent of no-code platforms. These platforms have eased the process of app development, making it accessible to a broader range of founders and startups, with all levels of coding expertise. In this, our first episode of the &lt;a href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/"&gt;What We Learned This Week In Proptech&lt;/a&gt; we explore this shift, leveraging insights from a recent discussion which sheds light on the practical applications of no-code solutions in various business scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Inevitable Pivot to No-Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, many tech professionals, including myself, viewed no-code platforms with a certain level of skepticism. It's not uncommon for seasoned engineers to dismiss these solutions as inferior or limited​​. However, this perception is rapidly changing as the benefits and potentials of no-code solutions become more apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No-code platforms offer a way to build applications without writing a single line of code. This is 
particularly valuable for small teams or solo entrepreneurs who need to deploy functional apps quickly without the resources to hire a full-time developer​​. For instance, when faced with the daunting task of creating a web application for loan origination, underwriting, and servicing, especially under the pressure of limited resources and a tight deadline, no-code solutions like Bubble become not just an option but a necessity​​.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Mechanics of No-Code Platforms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The principle behind no-code platforms is fairly straightforward: they provide an interface with drag-and-drop components that can be connected to various data stores. This approach simplifies the development process to the point where hosting is also taken care of by the platform itself​​.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a setup was instrumental when my co-host, Fernando, needed to pivot his business model due to significant changes in the commercial lending environment. With most resources laid off and a pressing need to adapt quickly, no-code platforms enabled rapid development and deployment​​.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choosing the Right No-Code Platform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I dove into Reddit forums and other communities to gauge the most popular no-code platforms, &lt;a href="https://bubble.io/"&gt;Bubble&lt;/a&gt; repeatedly came up as a frontrunner due to its strong footprint and search engine optimization (SEO) presence​​. Its capabilities extend to creating a blend of a marketplace and a project management tool, exemplified by a modified Upwork and Asana template​​.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, each no-code platform has its limitations and unique features. For example, Bubble uses its proprietary framework, which means you cannot export your code out of the platform. In contrast, platforms like &lt;a href="https://flutterflow.io/"&gt;Flutterflow&lt;/a&gt; offer the flexibility to export the code written in the Flutter language framework and continue development outside the confines of the original no-code environment​​.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No-Code Cost Efficiency and Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of employing no-code solutions is significantly less than hiring a developer, though it comes with a trade-off in customization. The analogy that resonates here is the difference between buying a prefabricated home and building a custom one from scratch​​. For startups and small businesses, especially in the property technology sector, the ability to quickly test and iterate on an idea without a large upfront investment is invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Reality of Tech Debt and No-Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A critical aspect of using no-code platforms is the understanding of technical debt. While no-code solutions allow for rapid deployment, they are not immune to the buildup of tech debt. Eventually, there's a need to review and refactor the functionalities built within the no-code environment to ensure scalability and efficiency​​.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, even with no-code solutions, a certain level of technical acumen is necessary. While platforms like Bubble and Flutterflow are user-friendly, they are still complex web applications that require some understanding of technology and design principles to use effectively​​.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Verdict on No-Code Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No-code platforms are changing the landscape of app development and business operations. They empower non-technical founders and teams to bring their ideas to life, providing an avenue for innovation and entrepreneurship that was previously gated by technical barriers. The key to leveraging no-code solutions lies in understanding their strengths and limitations and using them as a stepping stone towards more sophisticated and customized solutions as the business grows and evolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continue to witness the rise of these platforms, it's clear that they are not just a temporary workaround but a fundamental shift in how we approach problem-solving and development in the digital age. No-code is not just about building applications; it's about building opportunities and possibilities for a future where technology is inclusive and accessible to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tune in to our next episode when we'll discuss fundraising in proptech.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="no-code"></category><category term="coding"></category></entry><entry><title>Episode 2: Fundraising in proptech</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/episode-2-fundraising-in-proptech/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-01T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-10-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-10-01:/blog/episode-2-fundraising-in-proptech/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the second episode, Fernando Pizarro and I explore the complexities of fundraising in the proptech sector. We discuss the convergence of proptech and climate tech, highlighting how their ventures integrate sustainable practices into real estate technology. The episode concludes with insights into the evolving Proptech landscape, stressing the significance of strategic partnerships and a strong commitment to business goals.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/Fundraising-Fun-e2a6vr6/a-aaekent" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our latest episode of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech," my co-host Fernando Pizarro and I, Ryan Buckley, delved into the intricate world of fundraising in Proptech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Art of Fundraising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our conversation began with a reflection on fundraising trends. As Fernando pointed out, the financial markets for Proptech are in a state of flux, echoing my observations at Blueprint Las Vegas, where venture capitalists (VCs) exhibited a growing enthusiasm for the sector. This surge in interest is a positive indicator for startups seeking funding, even as the broader VC landscape faces challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando shared his experiences working at companies like Disney, National Geographic, and Yahoo, and his transition to startups in the Bay Area. His journey in gamification and Go-To-Market strategies, particularly in PropTech, offered a rich perspective on how funding dynamics have evolved over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discussed my own journey with Shovels, the company I co-founded. Our fundraising approach was shaped by lessons from my previous ventures and a determination to avoid the pitfalls I encountered earlier. I emphasized the importance of finding investors who share your vision and passion, echoing advice I received: seek investors who are "irrationally excited" about your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Climate Tech Connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant aspect of our discussion revolved around the intersection of proptech and climate tech. We explored how technology in real estate inevitably ties into broader environmental concerns. Fernando’s work in facilitating business owners with sustainable space development showcases this intersection too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Shovels, the connection to climate tech is direct. We leveraged building permits to identify competent contractors, particularly those skilled in installing eco-friendly systems like heat pumps. This approach didn't just align with our business goals but also resonated with many investors' commitment to environmental sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diverse Approaches to Fundraising&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our fundraising strategies, while guided by similar principles, took different paths. Fernando’s approach was deeply influenced by his rich network and personal connections. My journey with Shovels was a mix of leveraging networks and targeting investors aligned with our mission and vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of us agreed that while the process is challenging, the right investor relationship can be a game-changer. It’s not just about securing funds but about finding partners who contribute more than just capital to your venture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Future of Proptech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we wrapped up our discussion, we reflected on the future of Proptech and its inevitable intertwining with climate tech. This sector is not just about innovative technology; it's also about driving meaningful change in one of the world's most fundamental industries – real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode closed with an optimistic outlook for Proptech startups. Despite the varying challenges, the opportunities in this space are immense. The key lies in understanding market dynamics, aligning with the right partners, and staying committed to the vision.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="proptech"></category><category term="fundraising"></category></entry><entry><title>The growth of EV contractors in California</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/the-growth-of-ev-contractors-in-california/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-01T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-10-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-10-01:/blog/the-growth-of-ev-contractors-in-california/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this final article of our series on EV charger activity in California, we explore the growth of EV charger contractors. We highlight the flourishing EV charger space and provide examples of companies operating in different parts of the ecosystem. Additionally, we showcase the jurisdictions with the most active EV charger contractors and analyze the increasing trend of new contractor activity. The data underscores the growing demand for EV chargers and the expanding market for contractors in this exciting industry.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Growth in EV charger contractors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This the final article of our recent series on EV charger activity in California. You can also read about the &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/growth-of-ev-charging-in-california/"&gt;growth of EV chargers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/ev-charger-permit-processing-times-in-california/"&gt;EV charger permit approval timelines&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have seen the EV charger space flourish, with companies operating in many different parts of the ecosystem. Check out a few examples::&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EV charger hardware companies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://evocharge.com/"&gt;EvoCharge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://evercharge.com/"&gt;EverCharge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://evbox.com/en/"&gt;EVBox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chargepoint.com/"&gt;ChargePoint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EV charger software companies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://chargelab.co/"&gt;ChargeLab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://driivz.com/"&gt;Driivz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.noodoe.com/"&gt;NooDoe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://ampup.io/"&gt;AmpUp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EV charger services companies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kopperfield.com/"&gt;Kopperfield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://treehouse.pro/"&gt;Treehouse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://elephantenergy.com/"&gt;Elephant Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.quitcarbon.com/"&gt;QuitCarbon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And charge point operators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.evgo.com/"&gt;EVGo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.electrifyamerica.com/"&gt;Electrify America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/commercial-charging"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also sales and design tools like &lt;a href="https://www.monterra.ai/"&gt;Monterra&lt;/a&gt;, purpose-built to help installers (electrical contractors and EV charging project developers) design, quote, and propose projects faster - streamlining and automating an otherwise manual site design and sales process. It’s a busy space! That’s why we’re spending so much time looking into it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already showed that there’s been a boon in EV charger installs. With all of this activity, it seems that there should be an increase in contractor activity, too. That’s what we set out to prove, and the data says it loud and clear: the number of contractors doing EV charger installations is increasing throughout California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put things into context, nearly 30% of all EV chargers in the US are installed in California today, followed by NY, FL, TX, MA, and WA (making up 25% collectively). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Stay tuned, as we’ll soon dive into the data for FL and TX market in a future post!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the jurisdictions with the most active EV charger contractors since 2022:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sacramento County&lt;/strong&gt;: 429 contractors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berkeley&lt;/strong&gt;: 209 contractors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encinitas&lt;/strong&gt;: 203 contractors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oakland&lt;/strong&gt;: 140 contractors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anaheim&lt;/strong&gt;: 119 contractors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took the top two jurisdictions and looked to see if the number of active EV charger contractors has been increasing over time. Indeed it has! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ev-contractors-sacramento.png" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/ev-contractors-sacramento.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ev-contractors-berkeley.png" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/ev-contractors-berkeley.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend line shows that in Sacramento, another EV charger contractor has become active every quarter. In Berkeley, it’s another 1.5 contractors active each quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkeley and Sacramento have the most active contractors. In jurisdictions with fewer contractors, is the rate of new activity higher? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ev-contractors-grid.png" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/ev-contractors-grid.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower the base, the higher the slope, with dramatic recent increases in contractor activity in Anaheim, Sacramento, and Oakland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Sacramento (City) and Sacramento County are different permitting jurisdictions, so there’s no overlap here in the charts.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that there should be an increase in &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; EV charger contractors intrigued us, so we did that analysis, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="new-ev-contractors.png" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/new-ev-contractors.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chart shows the number of new contractors entering each of the jurisdictions each year. A new contractor is one that had no permit history in the years prior. You can see an acceleration happening between 2010 and 2022 as these jurisdictions add more &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; EV charger contractors each year. Anaheim is the outlier. They started high and stayed high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The EV charger market is growing at an increasing rate.&lt;/strong&gt; Supply of contractors (as well as hardware, software, and services) is responding to an increase in demand, and we can track this response using Shovels building permit data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we figured that another sign of market growth could be EV contractors expanding their own territories. We decided to look at the percentage of EV contractors doing work in multiple jurisdictions each quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="multiple-jurisdictions-ev-contractors.png" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/multiple-jurisdictions-ev-contractors.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This geographical expansion is also trending up, with a big surge during COVID that sustained after the pandemic retreated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool stuff, right? This means EV charging is hot. Dare we say &lt;em&gt;electric&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a good market to work and invest in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re excited by all of this data, and we want you to be excited too. Want to do your own epic analysis of the building trades? Get in touch: sales@shovels.ai.&lt;/p&gt;

Drawing inspiration from April Dunford's book, Obviously Awesome, they explore how positioning can significantly impact the success and perception of a product. The episode uses a compelling analogy of a bakery specializing in chocolate cake to demonstrate how different positioning (cake, muffin, lollipop) can create entirely different market segments and customer perceptions, even with the same product.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/A-Peek-at-Positioning-e2ap6fp/a-aage57p" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the ever-evolving world of property technology (proptech), understanding and mastering the art of positioning can be the difference between success and obscurity. In our latest episode of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech," Fernando and I delve into this critical business strategy, drawing parallels between a simple bakery product and complex proptech solutions. This comparison, inspired by insights from April Dunford's "Obviously Awesome," sheds light on how strategic positioning can make a significant impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Bakery Analogy: A Lesson in Positioning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine walking into a bakery that sells the most delicious chocolate cake. This cake is their flagship product, the crown jewel of their culinary expertise. Now, picture this cake being sold not just as a cake but also as a muffin or even a lollipop. This is where the concept of positioning comes into play. It's about how you frame and market your product to target different segments and create diverse customer perceptions, even if the core product remains the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of proptech, this analogy translates into how companies position their products or services in the market. It's not just about what you offer; it's about how you present it to your audience and how they perceive its value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shovels: An Evolution in Positioning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shovels journey serves as a prime example of effective positioning. Initially positioned as an API provider, the company recognized the need to pivot towards a more market-driven offering. By rebranding themselves as a go-to-market solution for lead generation, Shovels was able to tap into a more lucrative and relevant market segment. This shift wasn't just a change in our marketing strategy; it was a strategic move that aligned our product with the evolving needs of our customers and the market at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This evolution in positioning demonstrates the importance of being agile and responsive to market trends. Shovels listened to customer feedback, understood the changing landscape of proptech, and adapted their positioning accordingly. It's a testament to the fact that in the fast-paced world of technology, flexibility and adaptability are key to survival and success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aikito: Adapting to Market Needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aikito's story is another compelling case of strategic positioning. Initially offering financing solutions, the company pivoted to providing project management and contractor connections. This change was driven by a deep understanding of their customers' evolving needs and the market dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aikito's shift highlights a critical aspect of positioning: it's an ongoing process. As markets change and customer needs evolve, so must the positioning of products and services. Aikito's ability to adapt and reposition itself allowed the company to stay relevant and competitive in the dynamic proptech landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Importance of Aligning with Customer Needs and Market Trends&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key takeaway from our episode is the importance of aligning your product's positioning with customer needs and market trends. In proptech, where technology and customer preferences are constantly evolving, staying attuned to these changes is crucial. Whether it's through customer feedback, market research, or industry trends, understanding the ecosystem in which your product exists is vital for effective positioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Positioning is not just a one-time marketing exercise; it's a strategic decision that influences every aspect of your business. It affects how you develop your product, engage with your customers, and ultimately, how your business is perceived in the market. In the fast-paced world of proptech, getting your positioning right can mean the difference between leading the market or lagging behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the art of positioning in proptech, as illustrated through our bakery analogy, is about more than just marketing. It's about strategically aligning your product with the market and customer needs. It's about being adaptable, responsive, and always willing to evolve. As proptech continues to grow and change, those who master the art of positioning will be the ones who thrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continue to explore the fascinating world of proptech, Fernando and I are excited to share more insights and learnings with you. Stay tuned for more episodes of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech," where we delve into the trends, challenges, and opportunities shaping this dynamic industry!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="proptech"></category><category term="positioning"></category></entry><entry><title>How to use the Shovels V1 API</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-v1-api/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-13T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-10-13T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-10-13:/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-v1-api/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Shovels API provides an intuitive platform for proptech enthusiasts looking to leverage building permit data. Users can access and filter building activities via types or specific date ranges. The API employs 'tags' to categorize 33 distinct types of building activities.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So... you want to build something cool in proptech, and you figured out (wisely, I might add) that building permits will make your product &lt;em&gt;shine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is excellent news, and we are here to help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use header key-based authentication. There are two steps to authenticate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get your API key at &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai" target="_blank"&gt;https://app.shovels.ai&lt;/a&gt; . You will see it on your dashboard when you register and log in. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add your key to this HTTP header when you make a request: &lt;code&gt;X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href="https://realpython.com/python-requests/#request-headers" target="_blank"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt;  for more information about making HTTP requests with headers using Python. &lt;em&gt;(Note: you can use any programming language; we like Python 🐍)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Filters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learned early on that our customers wanted two types of filters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By activity&lt;/strong&gt;: Filter building activity by the &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; of activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By date&lt;/strong&gt;: Show the activity in between two dates, and always display the most recent activity first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tags&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's look at the building activity filter first. We call types of activity &lt;em&gt;tags&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We offer 33 unique tags as of this publication date in October 2023. That number will increase over time! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use tags, you need to know what they are. We named them to (hopefully) be self-explanatory. If you need clarification, you can check the Tags tab in the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qiIxx37_-6vGfGp2i5pXv4w2FdsLsShjCqSVO5v6OMQ/edit#gid=1842205445" target="_blank"&gt;Data Dictionary&lt;/a&gt; . We'll try to keep this updated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see a list programmatically, perhaps for your own internal dashboard or BI tool, you can always list our tags using the &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/List/operation/get_all_available_tags_v1_list_tags_get" target="_blank"&gt;Get All Available Tags&lt;/a&gt;  endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this extra super clear, let's go through some examples. I'm going to show the code snippets using Curl, a command-line tool available natively in every operating system. Just open a new command-line prompt (e.g. Terminal on MacOS) to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Get details on every heat pump installation in a zip code&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's use 94123, my old neighborhood in San Francisco. Start by finding the right tag (using the methodology above) for heat pumps: &lt;code&gt;heat_pump&lt;/code&gt; should do the trick!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, find the endpoint. &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/Permits/operation/get_permits_by_zip_code_v1_permits_zip_get" target="_blank"&gt;Get Permits By Zip Code&lt;/a&gt;  sounds about right! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make the request. Here's the Curl command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-X&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;GET&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;https://api.shovels.ai/v1/permits/zip?zip_code=94123&amp;amp;tags=heat_pump&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;size=50&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;-H&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;accept: application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;-H&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it worked! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;items&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;07ec97288669e01793a9dbb47c352400&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;address&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;street_no&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;3550&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;street&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;BAKER ST&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;city&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;SAN FRANCISCO&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;zip_code&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;94123&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;state&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;CA&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;lat&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m m-Double"&gt;37.804016&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;long&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m m-Double"&gt;122.44678&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;179c87dcfa6f499edff389c2272f819b&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;address&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;street_no&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;12&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;street&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;RICO WAY&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;city&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;SAN FRANCISCO&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;zip_code&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;94123&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;state&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;CA&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;lat&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m m-Double"&gt;37.805016&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;long&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m m-Double"&gt;122.438484&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do we do with all those &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; values? Each one is an internal ID for a Shovels permit. To get the details we want (since we probably want more than just the address) let's take the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; and pass it into our &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/Permits/operation/get_permit_by_id_v1_permits__id__get" target="_blank"&gt;Get Permit by ID&lt;/a&gt;  endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-X&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;GET&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;https://api.shovels.ai/v1/permits/179c87dcfa6f499edff389c2272f819b&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;-H&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;accept: application/json&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;-H&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we get this in response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;jurisdiction&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;San Francisco&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;issue_date&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;2017-09-07&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;final_date&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Plumbing&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;address_id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;1973404EE7003B21&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;status&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Active&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;179c87dcfa6f499edff389c2272f819b&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;tags&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;air_source_heat_pump&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;heat_pump&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;utilities&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neato! If we wanted to store all these heat pump installs in a database or spreadsheet, we could write more code for that. I recommend asking ChatGPT to do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Get all the heat pump HVAC installers in a zip code&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you don't care about the permits or the homes, and you just want to know who did the install? We can help with that, too! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our handy &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/Contractors/operation/get_contractors_by_activity_zipcode_v1_contractors_activity_zip_get" target="_blank"&gt;Get Permits By Activity Zip Code&lt;/a&gt;  endpoint should be perfect. We can use the same example, and we'll introduce dates this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this API call, let's find all the heat pump HVAC installers who did work in the first two quarters of 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -X &amp;#39;GET&amp;#39; \
  &amp;#39;https://api.shovels.ai/v1/contractors/activity/zip?zip_code=94103&amp;amp;tags=heat_pump&amp;amp;start_date=2023-01-01&amp;amp;end_date=2023-07-01&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;size=50&amp;#39; \
  -H &amp;#39;accept: application/json&amp;#39; \
  -H &amp;#39;X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&amp;#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note that our dates take the form &lt;code&gt;YYYY-MM-DD&lt;/code&gt;. This is important!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The response now is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &amp;quot;id&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;adfbb85fa395444c9516dcfe97ffcfb5&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;DENIZ SALON&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;business_name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;KA - BI CONSTRUCTION INC.&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Same deal. The &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; shown is our internal Shovels contractor ID. Let's hit our &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/Contractors/operation/get_contractor_by_id_v1_contractors__id__get" target="_blank"&gt;Get Contractor by Id&lt;/a&gt;  endpoint with it to get those contractor details! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -X &amp;#39;GET&amp;#39; \
  &amp;#39;https://api.shovels.ai/v1/contractors/adfbb85fa395444c9516dcfe97ffcfb5&amp;#39; \
  -H &amp;#39;accept: application/json&amp;#39; \
  -H &amp;#39;X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&amp;#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the details are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;license&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;944398&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;DENIZ SALON&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;email&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;denizsalon@yahoo.com,salon642002@yahoo.com&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;street&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;BAYSHORE HY&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;business_name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;KA - BI CONSTRUCTION INC.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;adfbb85fa395444c9516dcfe97ffcfb5&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;phone&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;6502914299&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;street_no&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;1290&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;city&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;BURLINGAME&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;state&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;&amp;quot;CA&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Dates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building permits have dates galore. We show file dates, issue dates, and final dates. File dates are when the permit was sent to the jurisdiction. Issue dates are when the permits are approved for construction, and the final dates is when the jurisdiction finally signs off on the finished work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our date filters, called &lt;code&gt;start_date&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end_date&lt;/code&gt;, are based solely on the file date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show how this works, let's look at permits filed in New York in August 2023. We can use our &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/Permits/operation/get_permits_by_state_v1_permits_state_get" target="_blank"&gt;Get Permits by State&lt;/a&gt;  endpoint! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -X &amp;#39;GET&amp;#39; \
  &amp;#39;https://api.shovels.ai/v1/permits/state?state=NY&amp;amp;start_date=2023-08-01&amp;amp;end_date=2023-08-31&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;size=50&amp;#39; \
  -H &amp;#39;accept: application/json&amp;#39; \
  -H &amp;#39;X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&amp;#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could use tags here too, but I chose not to. Here's what the first two permits look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;e101ca8b62f825a1199fb370365b85d7&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;address&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;street_no&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;3&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;street&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;NEW HAMPSHIRE AVE&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;city&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;EAST GREENBUSH&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;zip_code&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;12144&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;state&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;NY&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;lat&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m m-Double"&gt;42.625023&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;long&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m m-Double"&gt;73.725845&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;d0c345961c8c446f3e56655c0ddfca8a&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;address&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;street_no&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;410&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;street&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;ROCKAWAY AVE&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;city&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;HEMPSTEAD&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;zip_code&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;11581&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;state&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;NY&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;lat&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m m-Double"&gt;40.658535&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;long&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m m-Double"&gt;73.70126&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could look up the details on these the same way I described above. No need to repeat! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This API is meant to be fast to learn and easy to work with. If you have any questions (really!) we want to know and provide support so we can make it easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you find that you're looking for an endpoint that we're not offering yet, let us know. We just might build it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers! &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Customer Success"></category><category term="api"></category></entry><entry><title>October 2023 Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/october-2023-newsletter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-17T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2023-10-17T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-10-17:/blog/october-2023-newsletter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;You can now sign up for your very own Shovels API key and start building awesome stuff with building permits. Our new web application is going to have more features to find contractors, look up permits, and get all the permits on any address in the country.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This will be a newsletter about using the Shovels building permit API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a new war began since our last newsletter, and I think first of the children. I don't know how to help other than to put this little mention in this little newsletter and try to stay positive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that... back to permits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last month, I said we'd work on loading every state into the API. This month, I get to tell you it's done! Yay! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To celebrate this launch, we're making it easier to get API keys. You don't need to ask us first. Just register an account with &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;our sweet new app&lt;/a&gt; and get your API key 💪&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't know how to use an API? That's cool, for most of my life, I didn't either. I have a solution for you, too. Read below. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do like APIs, don't forget about our &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference"&gt;pretty API docs&lt;/a&gt; 😍 and check out our &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-api/"&gt;API starter guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-api/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;🇺🇸 The API is national 🇺🇸&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 100 million permits span:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;24,593,329 addresses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;14,688 zip codes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;973 jurisdictions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;656 counties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;48 states&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And across all of these permits we applied 33 unique "tags" in order to make it easy to cluster and slice these 100 million permits to your liking... &lt;strong&gt;all by using the Shovels API&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API wuh? 🤔&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's my attempt at writing the shortest-ever tutorial on how to use an API. We have a more detailed &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-api/"&gt;tutorial on the blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An API is like a set of defined questions you can ask a database using your favorite programming language. Each of these questions is called an "endpoint." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you can ask &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/Permits/operation/get_permits_by_address_v1_permits_address_get"&gt;this endpoint&lt;/a&gt; the question, "What are all the permits on 15 Cherry Lane, Anytown, MD?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can ask &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/Permits/operation/get_permits_by_zip_code_v1_permits_zip_get"&gt;this endpoint&lt;/a&gt; the question, "Which homes in the zip code 94123 pulled ADU permits in the last 6 months?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on... each endpoint is purpose-built for you to ask a certain type of question. The questions our endpoints can answer are described in our &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference"&gt;lovely API documentation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything's unclear, please holler at me! I'll be happy to share my screen as we do some programming together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;API keys galore&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've always thought that to be truly developer-friendly, a company should not stand in between developers and the API. The docs should be great, the API should be fast, and when inspiration strikes, software developers shouldn't have to wait for an API key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we've built an app to give you an API key whenever you want one. Just make an account at &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;https://app.shovels.ai&lt;/a&gt;. You'll see your shiny new API key on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: We built this thing for the web using a new mobile app technology called Flutter. That means we're going to release native mobile apps, too!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;100 million building permits in your pocket, coming soon to an app store near you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="App screenshot" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/app-auth-screenshot.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Spreadsheets for the rest of us&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone knows what JSON is. Even those in tech might think I omitted a vowel from the name of a popular YouTuber / investor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I have a solution. We will run CSV files you as you need them, one-off or monthly, for roughly the same price as our API. We won't give you the entire database, but we'll accommodate you if you'll accommodate a monthly subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSV files are super convenient and until we have a self-serve solution for you to query and download your own CSVs, we'll be happy to do it for you! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Pricing page is live&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One striking point I raised was the alarming vacancy rates in San Francisco - surpassing 30%. This trend was not just a local phenomenon but a broader reflection of the global shifts in the real estate market. "It's kind of like one of those Y2K level thresholds that you just don't want to be passed," I noted, drawing parallels between the current real estate situation and past significant events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Repurposing Commercial Spaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key part of our discussion revolved around the innovative repurposing of traditional commercial spaces. Fernando mentioned Aikito's involvement in such projects, emphasizing the importance of community in reimagining these spaces. "Community was the thing that was missing since the pandemic and it's what was missing when you work from home," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;San Francisco's Resilience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges, there were signs of resilience and adaptation in San Francisco. Fernando shared his recent experiences in the city, noting a surprising uptick in activity and cleanliness in areas traditionally perceived as less desirable. This observation sparked a conversation about the city's potential for recovery and transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Rise of Themed Commercial Spaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shared an interesting encounter with an entrepreneur who planned to convert a major building downtown into a climate-themed skyscraper. This concept of themed commercial spaces as a means to attract specific communities and businesses represented a novel approach in commercial real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The WeWork Scenario&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our conversation also touched upon the recent news of WeWork's bankruptcy, leading to a broader discussion on the future of coworking spaces. We agreed that while WeWork's model faced challenges, the concept of coworking remained relevant and was likely to evolve with more sustainable business practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Local Government&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the episode, we explored the role of local government in responding to these changes. I emphasized the potential of local policies to create opportunities or pose challenges in the evolving landscape of urban real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode wrapped up with us contemplating future discussions, particularly around the intricacies of commercial permitting and its impact on urban development.

They discussed the variations in permits across states, the insights gained from analyzing permit data, and the practical implications for businesses and property technology. The episode highlighted the importance of understanding permit trends and regulations in commercial construction and renovation projects.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/Everything-You-Didnt-Know-About-Building-Permits-e2bnefv/a-aajc8k4" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to our latest installment of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech." In this episode, Fernando Pizarro and I, Ryan Buckley, delve into a topic that's both fascinating and crucial in the realm of property technology: commercial building permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of a building permit might seem straightforward at first glance, but as we explored, it's anything but. We started by defining what a building permit is. Essentially, it's a document issued by local government authorities to regulate and track construction activities. This aspect of local regulation is vital because building standards and requirements can vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another. As I often say, the devil is in the details, and in the case of building permits, those details are critical for ensuring public safety and compliance with local laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando brought up an interesting point about the variety of permits available. Indeed, a building permit can refer to many different things, and this diversity is a crucial aspect of understanding the landscape of commercial building permits. What we find fascinating is how these permits serve as a gateway to a wealth of data and insights into construction activities, contractor histories, and market trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our discussion, we uncovered some intriguing insights, particularly about commercial permits. For instance, the proportion of commercial permits varies significantly across states. Surprisingly, states like Alaska have a higher percentage of commercial permits relative to residential ones, likely due to the lower overall number of residential permits. This finding led us to consider the implications of such data for businesses and contractors operating in different states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation then shifted to the practical applications of this data. For instance, by analyzing permits, we can identify trends in commercial construction, such as the prevalence of electrical work or the surprisingly low incidence of HVAC-related projects. These insights are invaluable for businesses and contractors looking to capitalize on market demands or for those in the property technology industry seeking to understand where their services might be most needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the more striking revelations from our analysis was the significant variation in the time taken to approve commercial permits across different states. New York, for example, stood out with an average approval time of over 500 days for commercial permits, a stark contrast to states like California and Texas, where the process is considerably quicker. This kind of information is crucial for businesses planning construction or renovation projects, as it directly impacts project timelines and budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando, drawing on his experience with Aikito, provided valuable insights into how this data applies to real-world scenarios. He noted the importance of understanding these permit trends, especially in the context of renovations and conversions of existing spaces, which is a significant part of Aikito's focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, our deep dive into commercial building permits revealed a complex and nuanced landscape. These permits are more than just bureaucratic necessities; they are a lens through which we can view and understand market trends, regulatory environments, and the ever-evolving world of property technology. As always, we aim to demystify these topics, providing our listeners with valuable insights and practical knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="building permit"></category><category term="building contractor"></category></entry><entry><title>Episode 8: Navigating commercial buildouts</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/episode-8-navigating-commercial-buildouts/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-11-15T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-11-15T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-11-15:/blog/episode-8-navigating-commercial-buildouts/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Episode 8 Fernando Pizarro and I explored the intricate process of commercial buildouts, discussing the importance of choosing the right space, the role of brokers, architects, and contractors, and the complexities of permitting. We also highlighted the transformative impact of technology in streamlining these processes, reflecting on the potential efficiencies it brings to the proptech industry.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/Opening-a-Restaurant-for-Dummies-e2c1bke/a-aakbtbq" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week on "What We Learned This Week In Proptech," Fernando and I delved into the intricate world of commercial buildouts. This topic, particularly close to Fernando's heart, unraveled the journey of a chef with a unique restaurant concept, ready to transform vision into reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our discussion began with the initial stages of a commercial buildout, where the focus lies heavily on finding and outfitting a suitable space. "It's all about turning that concept into a tangible reality," said Fernando, highlighting the importance of selecting the right location and designing the space to fit the unique needs of a business, like our chef's innovative chicken finger restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation then shifted to my experiences at Chubbles, where the week had been a mix of successes and challenges. The excitement of new subscriptions contrasted with the delays in releasing our national contractor API. "The main headache has been around infrastructure and release cycles," I said, emphasizing the complexities in technology deployment in proptech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando shared his insights on the role of commercial brokers, crucial in navigating the complex landscape of commercial real estate. "Brokers are essential in linking clients with architects, contractors, and negotiating lease terms," Fernando explained. However, he also cautioned about the delicate balance of brokers' incentives, particularly when negotiating work letters that define the condition of the leased space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also discussed the role of architects and general contractors in the buildout process. "Their expertise becomes pivotal once a space is chosen," I noted, underlining the importance of these professionals in the preliminary planning and execution stages. Fernando added, "It's a highly collaborative process involving numerous stakeholders."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key takeaways from our discussion was the significance of permits in the buildout process. "Permitting can be a complex and time-consuming stage," Fernando said, stressing the need for early engagement with architects and contractors to ensure compliance and avoid delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the conversation wound down, we touched upon the impact of technology in streamlining the buildout process. Fernando pointed out, "Tech platforms can significantly reduce time and complexity, bringing efficiency to a traditionally manual process." This insight aligns with the emerging trends in proptech, where technology integration is revolutionizing traditional practices.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="commercial permit"></category><category term="proptech"></category></entry><entry><title>Do rebate programs matter to contractors in the SF Bay Area?</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/do-rebate-programs-matter-to-contractors-in-the-sf-bay-area/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-11-19T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-11-10T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-11-19:/blog/do-rebate-programs-matter-to-contractors-in-the-sf-bay-area/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We look at the impact of BayREN's initiatives on the Bay Area's energy upgrade trends, revealing a significant increase in heat pump installations by BayREN-affiliated contractors compared to a lesser focus on solar panel installations. It suggests that BayREN is strategically filling gaps in the building electrification market.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A key player in the building electrification transformation in the San Francisco Bay Area is the &lt;a href="https://www.bayren.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Bay Area Regional Energy Network&lt;/a&gt; (BayREN). Over the past decade it has become synonymous with fostering environmentally conscious decisions among communities and building contractors alike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our recent research into building permits has revealed compelling trends that not only underscore BayREN's influence but also signal a shift in the region's approach to energy efficiency. By analyzing building permits, we discovered a stark difference in the uptake of various energy upgrades between contractors affiliated with BayREN and those who are not. This isn't just numerical variance; it's a narrative about where we're heading and what fuels our journey towards a greener Bay Area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bayren vs other contractors" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/contractors_comparison_chart.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data paints a telling picture: BayREN contractors are installing significantly more heat pumps than their non-affiliated counterparts. Why heat pumps? Heat pumps are a linchpin in the arsenal against energy inefficiency. They serve dual purposes, providing heating and cooling in a single system, and they're remarkably efficient, actually cutting down total energy use compared to traditional HVAC systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This finding aligns perfectly with BayREN's strategic priorities. By streamlining the installation of heat pumps, BayREN is not just pushing for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions; it's also promoting a technology that can adapt to and leverage the Bay Area's mild climate, proving to be both a cost-effective and environmentally friendly solution for local homeowners and businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the same research indicated that BayREN contractors install fewer solar panels than their peers. This could seem counterintuitive at first glance, given the solar industry's growth and the region's ample sunshine. However, this trend could be attributed to several factors. Perhaps the solar market in the Bay Area is already well-developed, necessitating less intervention. Alternatively, it could be that BayREN's current initiatives are designed to fill gaps in the building electrification market where other technologies, such as heat pumps, have yet to mature. It's also possible that the existing financial incentives for solar installations are already optimized, so BayREN focuses its resources on other technologies in need of a push.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to electric vehicle (EV) charger installations, the numbers align closely between BayREN contractors and others. EV technology is an area of robust growth, supported by statewide initiatives and private investments alike. The parallel trends here suggest that the push for EV infrastructure might be equally strong across the board, indicating that BayREN's efforts in this domain are complementing an already thriving market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do these trends mean for the Bay Area's energy landscape? They showcase BayREN's role in helping the region's energy efficiency trajectory. By fostering the adoption of heat pumps, BayREN is helping to redefine the standard for residential and commercial heating and cooling systems. This not only contributes to lowering carbon footprints but also aligns with broader goals of resilience and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data also prompts a re-evaluation of solar energy's place in the Bay Area's proptech scene. With the solar panel market potentially approaching saturation, it may be time to innovate further or redirect focus to complementing technologies that enhance solar efficiency or storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings illuminate the nuanced dynamics of energy upgrades in the Bay Area. As BayREN continues to lead with forward-thinking programs, it remains crucial for us to monitor how these initiatives shape both the demand and the labor market to install these systems. The shifts we see today, influenced by BayREN's strategic decisions, are creating a blueprint for other regions to follow. And as we continue to gather data and analyze trends, we look forward to contributing the conversation around proptech and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Data"></category><category term="bayren"></category><category term="rebates"></category><category term="climate"></category></entry><entry><title>Episode 9: Exploring AI in proptech</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/episode-9-exploring-ai-in-proptech/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-11-21T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-11-21T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-11-21:/blog/episode-9-exploring-ai-in-proptech/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In our latest podcast episode we discuss the evolving role of artificial intelligence in the proptech industry.

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we delved into the potential of AI in real estate listings. Using AI to write compelling, keyword-dense property descriptions based on images alone showcased the technology's capacity to understand and interpret visual data effectively. This capability can revolutionize how real estate listings are created, offering both efficiency and creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode concluded with a discussion on the future of AI in proptech and other industries. We pondered the technology's evolving nature and its potential to simplify complex tasks, foreseeing a future where AI's integration becomes more seamless and indispensable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, this week's podcast offered an insightful exploration of AI in proptech. We discussed the changing landscape of AI, its practical applications in content strategy, and its burgeoning role in real estate marketing. As AI continues to evolve, its impact on proptech and beyond is bound to be profound and transformative.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="commercial permit"></category><category term="proptech"></category></entry><entry><title>Episode 10: Navigating email marketing challenges</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/episode-10-navigating-email-marketing-challenges/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-11-29T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-11-29T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-11-29:/blog/episode-10-navigating-email-marketing-challenges/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This episode of our podcast delves into the complexities of email marketing, highlighting the challenges of declining effectiveness despite advancements in tools and personalization. We discuss diagnostic approaches to improving campaigns, the significance of SEO in organic marketing strategies, and the importance of selecting the right keywords for successful engagement. The conversation underscores the necessity of adapting marketing strategies to effectively reach and resonate with target audiences in the proptech industry.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/SEO-for-Proptech-e2cqe2k/a-aamqgs7" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 10th episode of our insightful podcast, Fernando Pizarro and I, Ryan Buckley, tackle a vital topic in today's digital marketing landscape: the effectiveness of email marketing campaigns, particularly in the proptech sector. This discussion is timely and significant, considering the evolving challenges and opportunities in digital marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We kicked off the episode with a deep dive into the declining effectiveness of email marketing. Despite advancements in tools and personalization techniques, response rates continue to fall. Fernando shared his extensive experience in email marketing since 2010, noting this trend and its impact on marketing strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drew on my experience to shed light on the intricacies of diagnosing and resolving issues in email marketing campaigns. We discussed various metrics like open rates, click-through rates, and the importance of list building. I emphasized the need for a diagnostic approach, akin to a doctor assessing a patient, to pinpoint specific areas of improvement in email marketing strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant portion of our conversation revolved around the relevance of content in email campaigns. We explored how subject lines might attract attention but fail to convert, highlighting the crucial balance between capturing interest and driving action. Fernando pointed out the common pitfall of focusing too much on features rather than benefits, which can hinder effective communication with the target audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transitioning from the challenges of email marketing, we shifted our focus to organic marketing strategies, particularly the power of SEO. I shared insights from my experience with Scripted.com, stressing the importance of consistent content creation as a long-term strategy. We discussed the nuances of static and dynamic content optimization, highlighting the necessity of a sustainable approach to content creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation then led to the practical aspects of keyword selection for SEO, underscoring the importance of choosing high-volume, low-competition keywords. I shared personal anecdotes about my journey with Shovels, particularly the deliberate focus on niche keywords like "building permit API," demonstrating the targeted approach needed for successful SEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our episode concluded with an exploration of the intersections between different marketing strategies, including social media and field sales. We touched on the unique challenges of reaching specific target audiences, like restaurant and bakery owners, through conventional digital marketing channels.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="email marketing"></category><category term="proptech"></category></entry><entry><title>December 2023 Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/december-2023-newsletter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-12-05T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-12-05T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-12-05:/blog/december-2023-newsletter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We added some new tools to the Shovels web app. We also now have a nationwide contractor directory, so anybody can look up contractors based on their service area, not just their work address. And we're doing a lot of data enrichment!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You can now look up permits by type and ZIP code or by postal address using &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;the Shovels app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal here is not to build the killer building permit SaaS app (that may come later). It's just to help you understand what's sitting in our database and give you some ideas about what to do with this data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since permits are tied to contractors, contractor profiles will start to appear here as well 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Shovels permit directory" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/permits-screenshot.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: see where contractors work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you go to Yelp, or Thumbtack, or Porch, or Angi, or any of those guys to find an electrician "near me," you'll get a list of electricians whose business address is near you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not really how electricians and other trades work. They travel! They don't stick to the same ZIP code as their business address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yelp et al, therefore, won't recommend the best electrician working in your neighborhood. Those guys have no clue who &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt; in your neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But we do!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/Contractors/operation/get_contractors_by_activity_zipcode_v1_contractors_activity_zip_get"&gt;API endpoint&lt;/a&gt; to find the most active heat pump (etc, etc) contractor that works in your ZIP code. We'll add a basic interface to the Shovels app to show you this too. Or if you want a sample CSV report, just reply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Heat pumps galore ☀️&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's undeniable that the world is getting hotter. We can debate how much humanity is at fault, but the increase in worldwide average temperature and all the trouble that causes is irrefutable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whodunnit, there's a new crop of well-funded "climate tech" startups trying to prevent the impacts from getting worse. Shovels is here to help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winds are shifting towards electric home appliances, and with that comes a tremendous business opportunity. Our timing here is perfect: the Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 is going to hit the markets in 2024. That means a TON of building electrification permits (heat pumps, EV chargers, batteries, and solar) and installations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it also means a lot of innovation and technology which will be visible in data that Shovels is uniquely capable of collecting. We intend to be the de facto leader in building electrification data going into next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's why I'm excited. Here's a worthwhile &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/09/business/energy-environment/heat-pumps-biden-tax-credits-rebates.html?unlocked_article_code=1.90w.qsq1.QP6pmedG0WQU&amp;amp;smid=url-share"&gt;New York Times article&lt;/a&gt; all about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Now what?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many things! I'll mention a few highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better contact info&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're partnering with a B2B and B2C data company to fill in homeowner and contractor contact details where they're missing on permits. We're also appending homeowner data fields like job title and seniority level, marital status, and much more. On the contractor side, we're improving phone and email coverage, as well as business websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result: some crazy awesome filtering for lead generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online advertising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you could run online ads to everyone with a solar panel installation? Or an ADU? Or any kind of remodel in the last 5 years? We're partnering with two platforms that can take our permit data online and build lookalike audiences to expand your reach. Let me know if you're interested!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tax assessor data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think it'd be pretty great to have all the tax assessor data (home value, lot size, number of stories, etc) alongside the building permit and building contractor data.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined with the better contact info, I believe this will put Shovels second to none in the proptech lead gen category 💯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm very curious what you think of the above. What should we tackle first?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category></entry><entry><title>Episode 11: Exploring the intersection of proptech and climate tech</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/episode-11-exploring-the-intersection-of-proptech-and-climate-tech/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-12-07T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-12-07T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-12-07:/blog/episode-11-exploring-the-intersection-of-proptech-and-climate-tech/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this week's episode, Ryan Buckley and Fernando Pizarro delve into the promising intersection of proptech and climate tech. They discuss the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act, the role of virtual power plants, and the implications of Local Law 97 in New York, highlighting the significant opportunities emerging at this crossroads.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/The-Intersection-of-Climate-and-Real-Estate-e2d4i3c/a-aanqf01" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 11th episode of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech," I had an enlightening discussion with Fernando Pizarro about the convergence of proptech and climate tech. This intersection is creating unique opportunities and driving innovation in both sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We delved into how climate tech startups, particularly those at the intersection with proptech, are gaining momentum. I shared insights from my experiences and meetings, emphasizing the perfect timing for such ventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The timing of climate tech startups, particularly the intersection of climate tech and property tech, is just really good right now," I noted, highlighting the market readiness for these innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode also touched on the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which I believe plays a crucial role in this sector. "It's pumping a lot of money, tens of billions of dollars, specifically into the intersection of climate tech and property tech," I said, underscoring the significant financial backing fueling these industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then explored the emerging trend of virtual power plants and the role of software in managing and distributing energy across the grid. This highlights the increasing need for technology in efficiently utilizing renewable energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando shared insights on New York's Local Law 97, which mandates buildings to reduce carbon emissions. This law has sparked a surge in interest for solutions that proptech startups can provide, demonstrating the regulatory push towards sustainable practices in real estate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, our conversation circled back to the significance of being mission-driven in the tech industry, especially in the realms of proptech and climate tech. "It's really nice to be mission driven," I reflected, emphasizing the satisfaction derived from working towards a greater good.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="climatetech"></category><category term="proptech"></category></entry><entry><title>Episode 12: Navigating culture in proptech</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/episode-12-navigating-culture-in-proptech/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-12-13T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2023-12-13T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2023-12-13:/blog/episode-12-navigating-culture-in-proptech/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Episode 12 delves into the intricacies of company culture in proptech. They discuss its impact on decision-making, diversity, and sustainability, underscoring its essential role in shaping company dynamics and future growth.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the 12th episode of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech," Fernando Pizarro and I delved into the nuanced and pivotal role of culture in the proptech industry. We explored how culture underpins decision-making and influences company dynamics, particularly in tech startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are talking about culture, a subject that is near and dear to my heart," Fernando began, emphasizing culture's omnipresence in every facet of a company. I echoed this sentiment, noting that culture occurs whether intentionally cultivated or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A significant part of our discussion revolved around how culture guides hard decisions. Fernando believed that culture comes to the forefront when making trade-offs. "Culture is what you fall back on when there's a tough call to make," he said, highlighting its foundational role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shared insights from the EconTalk podcast, which resonated with our topic. Andrew McAfee's thoughts on culture simplified it to 'how decisions are made.' This idea of constrained optimization, choosing paths when you can't do everything, resonated with both of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our conversation then shifted to how culture shapes companies' approach to diversity and inclusion. I shared my  view on this, favoring equality of opportunity over outcome. "I am a big believer of recruiting from non-traditional sources," I mentioned, discussing how varying perspectives enrich company culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando and I also touched on sustainability in proptech. Although sustainability isn't the only focus for my current business, its significance in the industry and its future role in our company culture were acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode concluded with reflections on the evolution of company culture. As Fernando and I shared our experiences and learnings, it was evident that culture, whether meticulously crafted or naturally evolved, is a cornerstone in the success and identity of proptech companies.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="culture"></category><category term="hr"></category><category term="proptech"></category></entry><entry><title>January 2024 Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/january-2024-newsletter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-01-04T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2024-01-04T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-01-04:/blog/january-2024-newsletter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A custom GPT, millions of new permits and hundreds of thousands of new contractors. This is a major update to our database and the way you can access it!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Nice, I get to be the 32nd person to wish you a happy new year in a marketing newsletter 🤗&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, let's get down to business!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the help of ChatGPT, we are officially putting the AI in Shovels.ai. Preview &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-zXFhOF8SP-shovels-ai"&gt;our custom GPT&lt;/a&gt; before it goes behind a paywall later this month. Tell it to look up some permits! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added a bunch of new contractors and then de-duplicated them so searching by name is less confusing. We also improved the way permits are queried by zip code!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And more things to do with permit data: calculate permit approval times (soon with even more granularity). &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-api/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;✨ Have you heard of ChatGPT? ✨&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be true that we are shovels.ai because the .com was taken, but we've always known artificial intelligence would play a major role here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OpenAI went and made doing that a whole lot easier by releasing custom GPTs late last year. These used to be called plugins, and they enable ChatGPT to interact with APIs like ours. So, we configured a custom GPT to use all of our API endpoints and &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-zXFhOF8SP-shovels-ai"&gt;released it to the public&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hear that OpenAI is going to release a GPT Store later this month. When that happens, we'll put the ShovelsAI GPT in there. But for now, anyone with a ChatGPT Plus account ($20/mo) can use our GPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, uhh... yea, it's pretty crazy. Here's what you can do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give it an address in plain text and ask for the permits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for a certain type of permit (heat pump? roof? foundation?) in a zip code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give it your address (or one nearby) and ask for a contractor recommendation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell it to make a CSV from any result and give you a link to download it 😎 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to release some more endpoints so you can filter by permit status, fees, and such. We'll also make it easier to filter by city (we only do zips and states right now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're super excited about this new way to use Shovels! &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-zXFhOF8SP-shovels-ai"&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🥳 A new product release worthy of 2024 🥳&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are also thrilled to announce our latest data update. Here are the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Enhancements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanded Coverage:&lt;/strong&gt; Our jurisdiction, ZIP code, and city counts have increased, offering wider and more comprehensive data coverage:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jurisdictions: from 1,041 to 1,106&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZIP+4 codes: from 113,255 to 121,926&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cities: from 41,582 to 46,813&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better Permit Geolocations:&lt;/strong&gt; Three million additional permits are now precisely geo-located, enhancing the accuracy of location data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More Contractors:&lt;/strong&gt; We increased the number of Shovels contractors by 17% to a total of 2.2M, covering 79K ZIP codes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fewer Contractor Duplicates:&lt;/strong&gt; we’ve grouped contractors that belong to the same entity within a state. Different branches should now be represented as one contractor company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API Improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More intuitive ZIP code queries:&lt;/strong&gt; Querying our API is now more straightforward and includes all +4 extension results even if you only provide 5-digit ZIP code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimized Queries:&lt;/strong&gt; The introduction of materialized views has significantly boosted the efficiency and speed of API queries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Pipeline Updates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabase Integration:&lt;/strong&gt; Automation in QA and validation processes is enhanced through Metabase integration, offering immediate access to data insights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;City Cleaning:&lt;/strong&gt; We've tightened our city cleaning process to ensure data accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address Updating:&lt;/strong&gt; Our permit address verification is more robust than ever, thanks to the automation of external address source processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Extraction Advancements:&lt;/strong&gt; Progress in extracting more accurate data from raw fields continues, improving the overall data quality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parallelism in Flows:&lt;/strong&gt; Processing efficiency has been boosted with further optimization of our data flows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Shovels permit directory" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/dashboard.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: track approval times&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to listen to &lt;a href="https://www.capstonegov.com/podcast"&gt;these podcast interviews&lt;/a&gt; of city council members, mayors, and economic development staff in Contra Costa County, where I live. Maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but I dig it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently, and I mean wayyy more than you'd think, these civic professionals talk about &lt;strong&gt;permit approval times&lt;/strong&gt;. The first mention was from the CEO of a local chamber of commerce. Then a very well connected commercial real estate broker said it. Then, once again, a local mayor mentioned how important this is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had coffee a few days ago with the CEO of a regional economic development agency out here and she too said permit approval times are critical data for city and county managers to track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels sees the permit file date and the issue date and can calculate the approval time. We did a &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/ev-charger-permit-processing-times-in-california/"&gt;really thorough analysis&lt;/a&gt; of California EV charger permit processing times back in August. I plan to write another one on nationwide permit approval times next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's some data from the midwest. What's going on, Louisville??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Shovels permit directory" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/midwest.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month I'll announce some major progress on a new and improved web app. It's already looking awesome. &lt;/p&gt;

This lawsuit could potentially lead to a transformative change in the industry, paving the way for more efficient and consumer-friendly proptech innovations.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/The-SitzerBurnett-Decision-e2elt8f/a-aas6e4k" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the ever-evolving landscape of property technology (proptech), 2024 has already marked itself as a year of significant developments. As we dive into the intricacies of these changes, particularly the Sitzer/Burnett case, it's clear that the traditional real estate industry is on the cusp of transformation. I explored these shifts in our latest episode of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech" with Fernando Pizarro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year kicked off with an insightful discussion around a pivotal lawsuit, Sitzer Burnett, that's currently in the appeal process in Missouri. The crux of this case lies in challenging the commission-based system prevalent in real estate transactions. As consumers, we've been bound to this model, particularly in scenarios where sellers are compelled to pay the buyer agent's commission. This system, deeply ingrained in the industry, is facilitated by key players like the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and the multiple listing service (MLS). The NAR's substantial membership and the exclusivity of MLS access to its members create a unique dynamic in the industry, one that's now under legal scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando and I discussed the monopolistic and cartel-like nature of this setup, where the NAR and MLS seemingly manipulate prices, inflating home costs and consequently harming consumers. A striking aspect of this lawsuit is the alleged 6% 'non-negotiable and anti-competitive' tax that costs consumers billions annually. This system essentially forces buyer agents into transactions, often inflating costs by significant percentages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on our personal experiences with real estate transactions, the sentiment towards this commission-based structure has long been one of skepticism. The prevalence of startups promoting 'For Sale By Owner' (FSBO) models highlights an ongoing resistance to traditional methods. These startups, along with platforms like Redfin or Zillow, challenge the necessity of buyer agents in an era where much of the preliminary house-hunting and negotiation can be conducted independently by buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the implications of the Sitzer Burnett case extend beyond just buyer-seller dynamics. Each MLS could potentially face its own lawsuit, as seen with subsequent cases in California. This legal pushback signifies a monumental shift that could dismantle the long-standing practices of the NAR and MLS. As Fernando noted, "it's going to be a ton of lawsuits that are going to be coming down the pike," driving significant behavioral change in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repercussions of this case could remake the industry, opening avenues for proptech companies to innovate and reshape real estate transactions. We see a future where AI could play a transformative role, potentially making traditional broker systems obsolete. AI, with its capability to analyze real estate data, legal requirements, and consumer preferences, could streamline transactions, reducing costs and enhancing efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the changes aren't just confined to residential real estate. The commercial sector, including leasing, might also see increased transparency and disclosure of commission arrangements. This could directly impact my field at Shovels.ai, which deals with construction permits. The potential alignment of our services with evolving industry norms offers exciting possibilities for innovation and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we navigate these changes, we must be nimble, keeping an eye on how our companies can leverage this upheaval. For proptech companies, this period is not just a challenge but an opportunity to redefine the industry, offering more transparent, efficient, and consumer-friendly solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the legal developments in the real estate industry signal a turning point for proptech. The dismantling of long-standing practices presents a unique opportunity for innovation and growth in the sector. As we at Shovels and other proptech companies observe these changes, we are looking to capitalize on an environment that promotes transparency, data access, and empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="culture"></category><category term="supreme court"></category><category term="proptech"></category></entry><entry><title>Episode 14: Davos and the DOE</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/episode-14-davos-and-the-doe/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-01-18T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2024-01-18T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-01-18:/blog/episode-14-davos-and-the-doe/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this compelling episode, Ryan Buckley and Fernando Pizarro shared their unique experiences at Davos and a White House roundtable.

&lt;p&gt;The latest episode of "What We Learned This Week in Proptech" with Ryan Buckley and Fernando Pizarro offered an intriguing juxtaposition of two distinct yet influential events: the World Economic Forum at Davos and a significant roundtable discussion hosted by the White House Office of Science, Transportation, and Policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando's experience at Davos was nothing short of fascinating. The event, known for its congregation of government, business, and non-governmental leaders, aimed at solving global issues, provided a platform for unprecedented networking and insights. Fernando’s interactions ranged from meeting the new president of the Club of Rome, a sustainability-focused organization, to engaging discussions on topics like AI and geopolitical happenings. The event's exclusivity, combined with its high-profile attendees, made for an environment rich in opportunities and spontaneous connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the globe, I had the privilege of virtually engaging with key figures from the White House and the Department of Energy. This engagement revolved around a pressing contemporary issue: building electrification and the challenges in obtaining permits for green infrastructure projects. The discussion highlighted the complexities of zoning changes, permit approvals, and the necessity for streamlined processes. This event underscored the critical role of proptech in facilitating green initiatives, a topic close to the heart of my work at Shovels.ai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both events, though contrasting in their settings, offered a shared theme: the need for innovation and collaboration in tackling global challenges. Fernando's insights from Davos emphasized the growing significance of sustainability and the urgent need for actionable solutions. My discussion with White House representatives echoed this sentiment, focusing on the bureaucratic challenges hindering progress in green infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The podcast episode culminated in a rich exchange of ideas and experiences, illustrating the vast potential for proptech to contribute meaningfully to these global conversations. From Davos’s high-altitude discussions on global sustainability to the White House’s focus on green infrastructure and permitting, the episode painted a picture of a world increasingly reliant on technological solutions to drive progress.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="culture"></category><category term="davos"></category><category term="energy"></category><category term="permit data"></category></entry><entry><title>Episode 15: The sexiest topic we've done so far: Zoning</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/episode-15-the-sexiest-topic-weve-done-so-far-zoning/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-01-29T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2024-01-29T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-01-29:/blog/episode-15-the-sexiest-topic-weve-done-so-far-zoning/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week, Ryan Buckley and Fernando Pizarro embarked on an insightful journey through the complexities of zoning and its pivotal role in proptech. They discussed zoning's historical roots, its impact on urban planning and development, and the innovative ways technology is being used to navigate and reshape zoning regulations for a more sustainable and efficient future in real estate.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/The-sexiest-topic-weve-done-so-far-Zoning-e2f3k57/a-aateuqt" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan Buckley and Fernando Pizarro did a deep dive into the world of zoning in their latest podcast episode. They explored the historical roots of zoning, initiated in New York City in 1916, to manage urban growth and separate industrial, residential, and commercial spaces. The discussion then shifted to the implications of zoning on socio-economic dynamics, highlighting the balance between development and environmental preservation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buckley shared insights into the complexities of modern zoning and its impact on property technology (proptech). He discussed the case of Houston, the largest U.S. city without conventional zoning laws, presenting a unique landscape for urban planning and development. The conversation also touched on innovative proptech startups like DeepBlocks, leveraging AI to navigate zoning compliance and enhance urban planning processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the episode, Buckley and Pizarro illuminated zoning's pervasive influence on daily life, development, and the proptech sector. They underscored the critical role of zoning in setting development guardrails and its evolving nature amidst technological advancements and urban challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Podcast"></category><category term="podcast"></category><category term="zoning"></category><category term="proptech"></category><category term="real estate law"></category></entry><entry><title>Episode 16: The proptech macro investing environment</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/episode-16-the-proptech-macro-investing-environment/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-02-05T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2024-02-05T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-02-05:/blog/episode-16-the-proptech-macro-investing-environment/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ryan Buckley and Fernando Pizarro offer an in-depth look at PropTech fundraising, from understanding different funding stages to analyzing current investment trends. Their discussion, enriched by Buckley's experience with Shovels and insights into investor expectations, provides valuable perspectives for startups navigating the fundraising process amidst a changing economic environment.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;iframe src="https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/thisweekinproptech/embed/episodes/The-Proptech-Macro-Investing-Environment-e2fdeda/a-aaubg2b" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an engaging discussion on the latest trends in PropTech investment, Ryan Buckley and Fernando Pizarro dissected a recent article by Brad Hargreaves, offering a timely examination of the state of PropTech investing. The conversation, rich with personal insights and industry analysis, ventured into the nuances of fundraising, from the early stages of securing capital to the strategic moves shaping companies' futures in the PropTech landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buckley shared his journey with Shovels, detailing their fundraising progress and strategic decision-making to manage dilution and value for early and potential investors. He elaborated on the distinctions between pre-seed, seed, and Series A funding rounds, shedding light on the evolving definitions and expectations at each stage. This provided a practical framework for understanding how startups navigate the complex terrain of investment, balancing growth, valuation, and investor relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernando and Ryan also explored the broader investment climate, discussing the impact of macroeconomic factors on fundraising and the sectors within PropTech drawing investor interest. They touched on the significance of AI and data management in attracting investment, highlighting the symbiotic relationship between data and AI in creating a competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dialogue further delved into construction tech's rising appeal, emphasizing the industry's delayed but accelerating adoption of technology and the potential for significant efficiency gains.

&lt;p&gt;🥳 Today we invite you to sign up for our first major software release! 🥳&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anyone can register at &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;https://app.shovels.ai&lt;/a&gt;! All you need is an email address. Here's &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-app/"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's free for now. There still are a few bugs I know about, and you'll find a few more. It's free because I want your feedback. I figure we'll start charging for access before the next newsletter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-zXFhOF8SP-shovels-ai"&gt;custom GPT&lt;/a&gt; is getting LOTS of use too. Who knew making building permit and contractor data accessible would be such a useful thing? (We did 😇)&lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-api/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The case for software&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels is a data company. That's our DNA. We're not very proficient (yet) at building software. We'll develop that skill as we go, but what will always set us apart is our devotion to clean, reliable, and useful data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We launched our nationwide &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/Permits"&gt;building permit API&lt;/a&gt; in August 2023. We followed that release with a &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/Contractors"&gt;nationwide contractor API&lt;/a&gt; in November 2023. We now have a bunch of paying customers and meaningful revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just getting this far is a big deal! And we'll continue to serve our current and new API customers. We ❤️ API deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as you know, the building trades are in transition. Many companies that have a clear, burning need for our data have no means to access it through an API. ChatGPT is great for figuring out what we offer and getting some samples, but it's not great for most commercial uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This all sounds good, Ryan," they would say. "Reach out again when you have software."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now we have software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🥳 Introducing: Shovels app v1.0 🥳&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you too excited to continue reading? I get it. &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to see it for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shovels app introduces our three data features: &lt;strong&gt;addresses&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;permits&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;contractors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Shovels online building permits filter" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/permits-filter.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this screenshot, we're looking up all active air source heat pump permits in California that mention the brand Mitsubishi. It's popular! I looked up Fujitsu (what we have) too and didn't see nearly as many. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other potential uses are endless:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for all new permits statewide last month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find all active commercial permits valued at over $1M&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for wave pool permits (yes, somebody asked for this once)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download to a CSV straight from the app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anywhere in the good ol' US of A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, wouldn't it be interesting to see which contractors did these Mitsubishi heat pump installs? Click on a permit and you'll get to a permit profile page. On that profile page is (usually) going to be a contractor. Click and that, et voila.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have contractor profiles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Map of building contractor in San Francisco" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/shane.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see every permit that Shane Patrick O'Malley (don't know him, hope he's nice!) has worked on. Shane does a ton of work in San Francisco. If you're curious, you can click on each of his permits and learn everything you need to know about each job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find more Shanes, hit the Contractors filter where you can look up all the heat pump installers in any ZIP code in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or if you just want to look up the permits on an address, you can do that too. Click on Addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="List of building permits on an address" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/addresses.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the address profile page we're eventually going to show a bunch of property attributes, all of the permits, and all of the contractors. Contractor profiles are going to show a summary of all of their permits by type, stage, and eventually all of their business branches too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeesh. There's always so much more to do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: even more heat pump contractors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr0G9miWRDY"&gt;did a demo of Shovels&lt;/a&gt; for the GreenHome Institute, a 501 c3 nonprofit with a mission to empower people to make healthier and more sustainable choices in the renovation and construction of the places we live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This turned out to be a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr0G9miWRDY"&gt;really long, interesting conversation&lt;/a&gt;. We got into the nuts and bolts of how permit data works, and since there were many trades professionals in the audience, we got to go deep on how we classify permits and rate contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/kr0G9miWRDY?feature=shared&amp;amp;t=1871"&gt;Scroll ahead to minute 31&lt;/a&gt; to see us dive into how the new Shovels app can help anyone find their perfect heat pump contractor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The future&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As implied, this is the start of a loooong development process. We've only just begun to build the killer building permits application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine being able to look up a jurisdiction like Palo Alto and see everything in the permitting queue and get estimates on how long the review process will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine being able to dive into building inspection results, even see who the inspector is, or see each step in the permit review process and how long it usually takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine being able to filter for contractors by the number of heat pumps they've installed and how long it usually took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, it's all on the roadmap! Read even more detail in &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-app/"&gt;our launch post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.

The app, built using Google's Flutter technology, allows users to find and profile addresses, permits, and contractors. The application was developed in response to a market need for a user-friendly platform that doesn't require API knowledge. Future updates will include Android and iOS versions of the app, improved geocoding, and additional search and filter options. The app is priced at $499/month per account.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are very excited to announce the launch of V1 of &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;the Shovels app&lt;/a&gt;. This is a web application you can access on any desktop or mobile browser. Now you can access our building permit and contractor data without an API standing in the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to share the history of how we got here and why building software is a pretty big deal for us. Then I’ll share what we’re releasing today and, importantly, what’s in store for the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How the Shovels API became an app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We like data. It’s in our DNA. The founders, me and Luka, met over mobile data. We were both building separate companies, attacking the mobile data market from different angles. We combined the companies so we could offer a more complete picture of the mobile data environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first hire, Petra, is a data engineer. She brought some big company experience with her, largely from the firmographic (company) data market. She also liked the challenge of making real-world data more accessible and useful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, that’s what we’re doing here. We’re making government data more accessible and useful. It’s a big challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we started really putting the building blocks for Shovels in place, digging and framing the foundation (to use an apropos building analogy), we understood that there would three core objects in the data structure: addresses, permits, and contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It made sense that they would be related. Permits have addresses. Contractors have permits. Therefore, contractors would also have addresses. We knew we could tie them all together in a relational database and help software developers build some really compelling applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they did, and they are. We’re really excited to be helping a new crop of property, real estate, climate, and construction entrepreneurs build cool new applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, we kept hearing from our own sales and marketing outreach that there was a product missing. They wanted to be able to browse the permits and contractors in our system. They wanted to be able to download this data without needing to contact us, wait for a reply, and then negotiate a price on a custom report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer became clear. We needed to build our own software product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The need for a building data application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not the first to aggregate and sell building permit data. If you look for it, you can find a half dozen other companies that have been doing this long before we started thinking about doing it in October 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, those incumbents are mostly stodgy old data services. They barely have an API and prefer to sell annual licenses to heavy datasets that only data engineers can parse and access. It’s not a startup-friendly approach, and when we looked these guys up, we weren’t impressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew that the first step for Shovels would be to launch an API. We did that for permits in August 2023, and we followed up a couple of months later with our contractor API. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like I said, it wasn’t enough. An API is not user-friendly. Most people in the building trades don’t know what it is. A lot of you reading this may not be familiar with the concept either. We were limited in who we could sell to, and the market continued to be underserved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By late 2023, we had the bandwidth to build our own software application using our own public API. We started building using a relatively new technology called Flutter. I’ll explain why this is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flutter is an open-source software development kit released by Google in 2015. Originally intended to be cross-platform, allowing developers to release both Android and iOS applications from a single codebase, it expanded in 2019 to also support web applications. Flutter 3 was released in March 2022. This is what we’re on today, and it will allow us to also release MacOS and Linux applications, in addition to web, Android, and iOS apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Flutter and technologies like it are awesome and I’m glad to be among the first companies to fully embrace it. We know that many people in the building trades live on their smartphones. They’re always on the move, so a mobile application makes sense. Flutter allows us to support our web application and mobile applications from a single codebase so we can develop and release faster than anyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re launching our web application today, but you can expect us to follow up with Android and iOS apps very soon! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Features of the Shovels app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are launching with the ability to find and profile each of our three core objects: addresses, permits, and contractors. Let’s go through each one! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Address Permit Profiles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is straight forward. Look up an address, get the permits! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Address profile page" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/5757-permits.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we see all the permits on 5757 Central Ave, Boulder CO, an office building outside of downtown Boulder. Yes, we cover commercial properties, too! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quick note: The address lookup process still needs some TLC. You may find that we don’t return addresses on properties you know have permits. That’s likely a geocoding issue, and we’re working on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are developing profiles on properties and these will become even more useful and robust in the coming months. Soon, you’ll find the standard property details (lot size, stories, square feet, etc) as well as contact info for the occupants. Use this for marketing, analytics, and your own product enhancements! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Permit Database&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to dig up this 5757 Central Ave property is by finding all commercial permits in the Boulder area. I searched for a downtown Boulder ZIP code and set our tag filter to “commercial” to see it in this list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Commercial permits in Boulder" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/boulder-commercial.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can click on any of these addresses to see the same level of detail shown in the previous snapshot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Permits zoomed in" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/boulder-commercial-1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other notes on our Permit Database:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search by keyword&lt;/strong&gt;: You can put any text you want in here and we’ll scan the descriptions of over 120M permits to find the ones that match.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search by state or zip&lt;/strong&gt;: Right now you can only limit the geography by ZIP code and state. Soon, you’ll also be able to search by city, county, or the permit jurisdiction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filter on permit fees and job value&lt;/strong&gt;: If you want to further refine your search, you can set minimum thresholds of permit fees and job values. The permit fees are collected by the county and the job values are self-reported, usually by the contractor. Note that not every jurisdiction collects these values, but if they do, we’ll have them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download to a CSV file&lt;/strong&gt;: Each of our tables includes a download feature so you can take this data into your other software products and make magic happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Contractor Directory&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our third feature is also suitable for personal use. Have you ever needed to find a contractor and wished you could just see who all of your neighbors used for that remodel, or cottage, or solar installation? The benefits of hiring someone who’s been in your neighborhood before are several:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most houses in a neighborhood were built around the same time, often by the same developer. Therefore, they have similar attics, crawl spaces, and wiring. It helps when a contractor knows what your house feels like before he shows up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permitting can be challenging, so it’s best to hire a contractor who knows what to expect of your local building department. If they know him, they may treat his permit requests differently. These little things matter!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contractors who know your neighborhood are invested. They want to do a good job, because they want you to recommend them. It’s best to hire someone who wants to expand their business in your neighborhood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you know what &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; tell you who works in your neighborhood? Yelp. Or Google. Or Nextdoor (unless you put up a post and ask.) The only reliable, consistent, accurate way to find which contractors work in your neighborhood is to use building permits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s what we do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Find building contractors by permit type" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/find-by-job.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I’m looking for every commercial contractor in the same Boulder ZIP code. How do we know a contractor is “commercial”? We know by their permits. This feature searches for commercial permits and then returns all of the contractors on those permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes sense, right? Seems like something like this should have been out there long ago, right? We agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s coming out next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that everything we’re doing here is available on &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference"&gt;our public API&lt;/a&gt;. We are building this app using the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; endpoints that our customers can access. This software app is kind of like an API demo, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re already working on V2 of our API. The V2 will have a bunch of cool new stuff like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Searching for permits using lat / long coordinates. That way you can drag the map and we’ll automatically update the permit results!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Searching by cities, counties, and jurisdictions. We know it’s frustrating to search by ZIP code. There are reasons why we did it that way to start, and the V2 will fix that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeing a jurisdiction dashboard. Wouldn’t it be great to see a dashboard of every permit under review, recently approved, or finalized in any jurisdiction in the country? We’re on it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get property details with the permit history. We’re going to include tax assessor data in future address profiles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s just a sneak preview! Before we can update our app, we have to update the API. It’s already under development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Does this cost anything, by the way?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! We are going to charge $499/mo per account for access to all of this amazing data. You’ll get a generous trial period, though, and all of our constant updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we release the V2, price will probably go up, but we’ll won’t raise prices on our early customers. &lt;/p&gt;

We can also now share tables to Snowflake, Big Query, and Databricks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last month we launched &lt;a href="https:/app.shovels.ai"&gt;our web app&lt;/a&gt;. This month we're offering even more ways to get your hands on our building permit and contractor data!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we want to meet you IRL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few days ago we launched an &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shovels.shovels1"&gt;Android app&lt;/a&gt;. You can find it now on Google Play. Next month we'll launch on the Apple App Store, too. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let's meet! The Shovels team will be in SF from March 18-19 and LA on March 21. We'll come to your office. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots more data and API enhancements. Details below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can now push permit and contractor tables into Big Query, Snowflake, Databricks, S3, GCS, and Azure! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;We're so mobile&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built the Shovels app using a relatively new technology called Flutter. This software development kit gives our small team a ton of leverage to build cross-platform and make rapid improvements to the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's because of Flutter that we can build a web app and a mobile app at the same time, with the same code, and without a ton of cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could say it gives us mobility. We're moving fast! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a few screenshots of our Android app. Get it on &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shovels.shovels1"&gt;Google Play now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(We could have launched iOS too, but I gotta save &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; for April.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Mobile app screenshots" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/screenshots.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hang out with us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shovels team is international. I'm in California. Luka and Petra are in Europe. We only meet in person a couple of times a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucky for you, the next convening is happening the week of March 18 and we want to meet. We'd love to come to your office and chat face-to-face about how you think about building permit and contractor data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about a small team is we can fit in a single Uber. We'll come to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;San Francisco: March 18-19   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LA area: March 21&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just reply to me and we'll figure out a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Shovels in your data lake&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that for many of you, API access doesn't fully scratch the itch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have bigger plans that will be realized only if you can merge our permits with your own data. We can send you our db files, but to pull them into Snowflake (or wherever) you'll need help from your engineering team and oh boy, that'll take forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a solution for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're now offering private shares of our production database tables into Big Query, Snowflake, Databricks, S3, GCS, and Azure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's super fast and easy and gives you unlimited access to query and join our permit and contractor tables with your data lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've already done the engineering -- so you don't have to! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Shovels March release&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a new month, and with that, a bunch of new fixes. Here's our March release notes. We pushed all this to production about a week ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better address validation&lt;/strong&gt;: We've improved our ability to validate and enhance cities and ZIP codes on permit addresses. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvements in contractor grouping&lt;/strong&gt;: We're using more comprehensive details, including addresses and phone numbers, to cluster contractor branches into groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new address dataset&lt;/strong&gt;: We added over three million exact geo locations to our permits table. We are closing down the gap of unlinked permits (permits without geo coordinates).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvements in our internal docs&lt;/strong&gt;: We move fast but we also recognize that investing in good documentation now will save us headaches later. We created a new internal knowledge base.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API enhancements&lt;/strong&gt;: We introduced a &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/Permits/operation/get_permits_by_id_v1_permits_get"&gt;new API call&lt;/a&gt; that allows for the specification of multiple permits in a single request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database optimization&lt;/strong&gt;: In response to API usage patterns, we've restructured our database architecture. No more timeouts!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;: We have integrated with an awesome tool to help us track API usage, errors, and patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: make permit predictions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever noticed that when one of your neighbors gets an ADU, or installs solar panels, or does the huge remodel and room addition, it seems to trigger everyone else in the neighborhood to do the same? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's FOMO in the home improvement market. I think we can measure this "Keeping up with the Jones's" phenomenon with building permit data and start to see where this wave of home improvements might be swelling in a particular neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not enough of a data scientist to give this justice (and apparently ChatGPT isn't either -- it wasn't very helpful this time) but with our table sharing (see above), perhaps &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can crack this riddle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a chart showing the distribution of the percentage of homes with permits since 2023 by ZIP code. What I mean by that is how much variance is there in "permits per capita" nationwide? Most ZIPs have low permit density, but a few are very active ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's causing the difference? We don't know yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Distribution of permit density by ZIP code" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/permits-distribution.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This is long enough&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next month I plan to announce our iOS app and give a teaser for our V2 API and describe how it will improve the Shovels web and mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category><category term="newsletter"></category></entry><entry><title>The list of every building permit jurisdiction in the US</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/list-of-all-building-permit-jurisdictions/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-04-06T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-04-06T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-04-06:/blog/list-of-all-building-permit-jurisdictions/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shovels is open-sourcing of a comprehensive list of building permit jurisdictions that we discovered only recently. Our new database includes over ten thousand building permit jurisdictions and associates each jurisdiction with a county and state.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are thrilled to announce &lt;a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rbucks/building-permit-jurisdictions-in-the-united-states" target="_blank"&gt;another Kaggle dataset&lt;/a&gt; from the Shovels vault. Our &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/images/jurisdiction_mappings.csv"&gt;latest file&lt;/a&gt; is a comprehensive mapping of state, county, and building permit jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is this list of building permit jurisdictions?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file includes over 10,000 building permit jurisdictions (AHJs -- authority-having jurisdictions), and relates each jurisdiction to its respective state and county. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found this mapping buried in an &lt;a href="https://socds.huduser.gov/permits/" target="_blank"&gt;obscure government website&lt;/a&gt;. We noticed that when we clicked on a state, a select box appeared with all of the counties in that state. This mapping is widely available from the US Census and many other open data sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when we clicked on the county, another select box appeared with every building permit jurisdiction in the county. &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; got our attention. Before this discovery, we didn't know of a single source of truth for how many AHJs are out there for building permits. Now we can count at least 10,000 of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who needs a list of every building permit jurisdiction?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When architects, developers, and homeowners start a new project, the first question they might ask is, "Where do I file my building permits?" The answer is far from obvious! Many cities don't have building departments; they delegate building permitting to the county.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list we are open-sourcing today includes every building permit jurisdiction. If a city or town is on this list, then they issue their own building permits. If a city or town is not on this list, then it's safe to conclude that their AHJ is the county. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We figure many folks who work in cities and counties don't know every AHJ within their boundaries. Now they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How many building permit jurisdictions are in each state?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got curious and decided to ask this data a few questions. How many AHJs are in each state? Does that jurisdiction count correlate with population? We had to merge in some public census data to figure this out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, there are about ten permit jurisdictions per county. If a county has a million residents, that means each permit jurisdiction serves about 100,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania stands out with the highest number of permit jurisdictions, totaling 1575. No other state comes close! It's unclear why Pennsylvania needs so many of them. For example, although Pennsylvania has the same population as Ohio, it has almost 3X the number of building permit jurisdictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chart makes the outliers easy to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Population vs Jurisdiction Count" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/jurisdictions-vs-population.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's a table of every state, its population, number of jurisdictions, and the ratio of jurisdictions per 100,000 residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beam is an easy-to-use financial platform whose mission is to empower builders with better financial tools and services. Beam helps contractors take control of their project finances,  improve cash flow, and ultimately earn more money.  One of the ways they grow their business is through cold outreach to contractors. This is an effective customer acquisition strategy provided there is a source of quality leads, and an opportunity to reach out at the right time with a personalized message. When expensive lead lists yielded poor results, Beam turned to Shovels. Shovels' ability to provide high-quality, regularly updated leads enriched with information such as permit type and recent activity proved to be a game changer for Beam’s outreach efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beam’s Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of homes and infrastructure are built and maintained by small and midsized contractors. However, most financial software has underserved these businesses, and many great builders still rely on paper checks, spreadsheets, and accounting software from the 90s. As a result, the payment process is error-prone and inefficient, leading to long delays and cash flow challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beam’s easy-to-use financial platform is built to serve the needs of small and mid sized contractors to help them move their processes online, speed up payments, and better manage their cash flow. In order to acquire new customers, Beam relied on cold outreach as one of their strategies.This proved to be challenging - lead lists were expensive, often contained information about companies and contractors no longer in business, and had no information on specific projects the business was engaged in or its recency. These lists had better data about the types of companies found on LinkedIn and not the small and medium sized businesses who were Beam’s target customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beam therefore resorted to looking up contractor information on the Contractors State License Board (CSLB) public database, and this yielded a massive list. Calling businesses one at a time was inefficient. Many licensees contacted were either not in business anymore or were not actively working on a project. As a result, the yield rate from cold outreach was poor and the return on investment of time and effort was very low. Beam sought a better solution to high quality lead generation, and found that Shovels had the perfect solution to their challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Beam chose Shovels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels analyzes over 100M building permits to help customers with lead generation by offering a comprehensive and filterable database tailored to the construction sector, adding between 5 and 10 million new permits nationwide every month. Raw permit data is cleansed, parsed, granularly categorized, and enriched with other data such as contractor profile information through cross referencing multiple data sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels’ ability to deliver high quality data containing detailed information including the type of permit filed, the date of filing, the profile of the contractor who applied for the permit and the permit fees paid made the company’s offering stand out. Top notch customer service during the sales and onboarding process sealed the deal for Beam. 
Shovels enabled Beam to efficiently and cost effectively generate a lead list, personalize their messaging, and reach out at the right time to prospects, thus scaling their cold outreach and providing a significant edge to grow their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Beam Used Shovels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Shovels became an integral part of Beam's cold outreach strategy,  their outreach efforts underwent a significant transformation. For instance, when the latest weekly data from Shovels listed a contractor who had pulled an ADU permit in the past month, the Beam team would swing into action and promptly reach out to the prospect using the contact information provided in the data feed. They would then establish rapport with the potential customer by citing an example of another customer who also constructs ADUs, whom they had assisted in achieving cost savings and efficiency. This type of timely, personalized outreach helped Beam earn trust and sign up new customers, eventually proving to be a game changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integration of Shovels data in Beam’s cold outreach strategy resulted in a remarkable 20 to 30% higher likelihood of contractor engagement. Not only was Beam able to save time and effort by only reaching out to those contractors who had recently applied for a permit, they were also able to win new customers at a higher rate through personalizing their outreach efforts and reaching prospects at the beginning stages of a new project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The periodic data updates from Shovels helped fill Beam’s sales pipeline with prospects and helped the Beam team nurture awareness which subsequently transformed to consideration and high purchase intent among their target customers. The data also provided the Beam team with information about the other projects the contractor was working on, as well as information about derivative metrics such as inspection pass rates enabling future business opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

We know you are too. This is the start of the killer building permit application. The one that should have existed all along. We also can push 100 million building permits and contractors straight into Snowflake, Big Query, and Databricks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Shovels April 2024 Newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month was a planning month for us. Luka and Petra joined me in California and we spent a lot of time together. We met a few of you in person, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this mingling and meeting helped us set the stage for the next phase of Shovels. We're growing up a bit. I'll explain what I mean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shovels V2 is in the works! I'll share more about what exactly this means. In short: a whole bunch of stuff you've told us you need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because the V2 is our focus, I've neglected our iOS app development. It's just so V1. We'll get it launched in prep for V2, but it'll take us another month. In the meantime, we've been updating &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shovels.shovels1"&gt;the Android app&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PSA: We can now share 130M permits and 2.5M contractors directly into your Snowflake, Big Query, or Databricks account. This makes some data scientists VERY happy. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ever wanted a list of every building permit jurisdiction? &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/list-of-all-building-permit-jurisdictions/"&gt;We released one&lt;/a&gt;. We're working on a V2 of that, too. It will have at least 5,000 more jurisdictions!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check out how &lt;a href="https://www.trybeam.com/"&gt;Beam&lt;/a&gt;, one of our happy customers, is using Shovels to &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/case-study-revolutionizing-lead-generation-for-beam/"&gt;reach out to contractors&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There comes a time when you just need to cut bait and start over. After watching you use and build on Shovels, and building our own web and mobile apps, it became clear that our API design needed an overhaul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And not just a 1.1. We needed to sorta break everything. (But don't worry, V1 will be out for a while, and we'll help you through the transition!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what's so awesome about our V2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filters galore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're combining tax assessor data with permit data! The possibilities are endless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filter building permits by lot and building area size, and number of units and stories. Want every solar permit on a $2 million house? Every ADU permit on a 20,000 sq ft lot? You'll have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll also be able to filter permits by city, county, and jurisdiction. I know, long time coming on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, there will be parity between permit and contractor filters. Want every solar &lt;em&gt;contractor&lt;/em&gt; who worked on a $2 million house? Every ADU &lt;em&gt;contractor&lt;/em&gt; who worked on a 20,000 sq ft lot? You get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn't possible in V1 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All new tagging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Shovels user filters by permit tags. Now we're going to make them wayyyy better. Thanks to some AWS incubator credits, we can use AI to tag all 130M permits for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're adding new tags and making them two-level. Check out the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15rq0VbzD1FKcBzWAhGaAwbqlqm-BZa6nhM8F_qyNcMQ/edit#gid=0"&gt;working draft here&lt;/a&gt; and reply with your feedback. Let us know what's missing! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The early tagging results are as amazing as you'd expect. What a time to be a data company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More contact info&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have A LOT more contact info on homeowners and contractors than we currently expose through the V1 API. This is going to change in V2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In V2, you'll get the homeowners of a given address, all the people who work at a contractor company, and all the contact info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one customer recently told me, the industry needs a ZoomInfo for the building trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we know which contractors are actually active, Shovels is in the perfect position to deliver it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All the profiles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things we hear from customers is that Shovels is useful for investment and market selection decisions. However, we don't make it easy for them to count and roll up all of the permits by geo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's fixed in V2. I mentioned that cities, counties, and jurisdictions will be filters. Well, they'll also have profiles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to see every building permit in flight in Palo Alto? How long it's taking to get approval? We'll calculate permit approval times by tag or tag group. We'll also help you navigate between counties, cities, ZIP codes, and the elusive jurisdiction. Each one will have a profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addresses will have profiles too! See all the permits, contractors, and roll up metrics on any address in our database. This is also coming in V2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're a data company, but the software play is just so obvious. Somebody needed to build it. Why not us? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a little preview!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Explore our permit data using our web app" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/explore.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: get customers&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the companies we spent time with in San Francisco is &lt;a href="https://www.trybeam.com/"&gt;Beam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beam helps contractors run invoices, collect payments, send estimates, and streamline other time-consuming parts of the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They're a smart, passionate team that loves to use data and technology to be more efficient, especially in their marketing. We're pleased to provide them with contractor and permit data that increases the conversion on their outreach and drives more revenue to their bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the full case study &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/case-study-revolutionizing-lead-generation-for-beam/"&gt;on our blog&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/pdfs/Shovels_Beam.pdf"&gt;download the PDF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;So tell us what you want, what you really really want&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction to Shovels AI Custom GPT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the construction and renovation industry, finding accurate and timely information on building permits and contractors is essential. The &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-zXFhOF8SP-shovels-ai"&gt;Shovels custom GPT&lt;/a&gt; is a sophisticated tool designed to streamline this process. It interacts with the &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference"&gt;Shovels API&lt;/a&gt;, providing users with easy access to detailed data on over 113 million building permits and 3 million contractors across 48 states in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post will guide you on how to effectively use this tool, with some cool examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key Features of Shovels AI Custom GPT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Coverage&lt;/strong&gt;: Access data related to building permits and contractors in nearly every U.S. state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tag-based Searches&lt;/strong&gt;: Perform searches based on specific types of work such as roofing, windows, pools, or EV chargers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State and Zip Code Filters&lt;/strong&gt;: Limit your search to specific states or zip codes to find localized information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date Filters&lt;/strong&gt;: Search permits based on the start and end dates of permit filings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started with Your Query&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the most out of Shovels AI, start by determining the type of information you need. Here are some steps to follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Your Query Type&lt;/strong&gt;: Decide whether you need information on building permits or contractors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Specify Location&lt;/strong&gt;: You can filter your search by state or zip code. For example, if you're interested in construction activities in Texas, mention it in your prompt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select a Tag (if applicable)&lt;/strong&gt;: If you're looking for specific types of permits, like those for electrical work, you will need to tell the GPT what you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example Queries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Query 1: Searching for Roofing Permits in a Zip Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose you want to find all recent roofing permits in the 90210 zip code. Here’s how you can use the tool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;Show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;roofing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;permits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;zip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;90210&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GPT will then provide a list of roofing permits in this area, detailing the permits’ descriptions, filing dates, and associated contractors if available. Sometimes it won't give the contractors, though. If that happens, ask for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;List the contractors too
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Query 2: Finding Contractors Specialized in Pool Installations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need a contractor for a new pool installation in Orlando, Florida, you need to look up some ZIP codes in Orlando. As of this writing, Shovels does not currently support city-based searches. Once you have the zip code, you can proceed! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;Show&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;contractors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;who&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;did&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;pool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;permits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;year&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32805&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will result in a list of contractors who have recently installed pools in 32805.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips for Effective Searches&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ensure Complete Addresses&lt;/strong&gt;: When searching by address, make sure to provide the full address including street number, name, and zip code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Tags&lt;/strong&gt;: Be specific about what types of permits you want. The GPT does a pretty good job of choosing the right Shovels permit tag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use Dates&lt;/strong&gt;: Remember to include a date range if you want one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shovels custom GPT is an easy way for anyone looking to access detailed, localized information on permits and contractors quickly. By following the steps outlined in this blog, you can quickly get the data you want.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Customer Success"></category><category term="ai"></category><category term="chatgpt"></category><category term="openai"></category></entry><entry><title>Case Study: Empowering Carbon Free Homes</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/case-study-empowering-carbon-free-homes/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-05-13T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-05-13T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-05-13:/blog/case-study-empowering-carbon-free-homes/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Discover how Carbon Free Homes, in partnership with Shovels, successfully met 100% of their installation targets for eco-friendly appliances like heat pumps and water heaters in Marin County, CA.

&lt;h1&gt;Shovels Empowers Carbon Free Homes: Achieving 100% Installation Targets with Our Contractor Matching Platform&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon Free Homes faced significant difficulties in connecting homeowners with qualified contractors for the installation of heat pumps, water heaters, and other climate-friendly appliances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite a growing awareness and demand among homeowners for such technologies, the availability of trustworthy contractors who are capable, willing, and ready to take on these projects was limited. The traditional methods of finding these contractors were inefficient and often led to unreliable data that hindered scalability and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address this challenge, Carbon Free Homes turned to Shovels, a comprehensive and filterable database drawn from over 100 million building permit applications nationwide, updated monthly. Shovels provides detailed, high-quality data that includes the type of permit filed, the date of filing, and the profile and contact information of the contractor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution enabled Carbon Free Homes to efficiently connect homeowners with reputable contractors, significantly reducing the time and effort required to sift through data manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collaboration with Shovels led to remarkable outcomes for Carbon Free Homes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Achieved 100% of the target numbers for pilot installations of heat pumps, water heaters, and induction stoves in San Anselmo and Fairfax, Marin County, CA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streamlined the process of contractor matching, which was previously a major bottleneck, enhancing customer satisfaction and trust in the marketplace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitated a group buy program that provided homeowners within a service area access to more competitive bids and seamless installation processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This efficient system not only improved the rate of successful installations but also supported the expansion of Carbon Free Homes' service offerings, including the launch of their Collaboration Energy group buying platform.&lt;/p&gt;

They are currently seeking feedback on their clickable prototype for version 2, which integrates comprehensive building permit and contractor data into one app. Additionally, they are advancing their data capabilities with AI-enhanced tagging and climate tech initiatives, emphasizing the importance of building permit data in reducing fossil fuel consumption and promoting sustainable building practices.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Shovels May 2024 Newsletter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Since we last wrote, our team of 3 grew 33%. We're now a team of 4. We're stoked to welcome &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bettywan7/"&gt;Betty Wan&lt;/a&gt; to Shovels!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luka and I have known Betty for years and we knew she'd be perfect to lead our revenue efforts. The timing worked, so here we are.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's top of mind as we move to make Shovels 33% better and grow 33% faster. Here's what's up!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a clickable prototype of V2. I need to schedule some &lt;a href="https://shovels.pipedrive.com/scheduler/GXeGebUW/shovels-v2-prototype-test"&gt;short 15 minute calls&lt;/a&gt; to watch &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; click through it. Trade 15 minutes for some permit data? &lt;a href="https://shovels.pipedrive.com/scheduler/GXeGebUW/shovels-v2-prototype-test"&gt;Let's chat!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our new tagging system is almost ready for launch. Our first AI-enhanced tags will be live before the next newsletter! More on this process below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More jurisdictions, more duration calculations, and more contractor de-duplication was in our latest batch release, which was processed using way more automation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because every day is Earth Day 🌱 we have a new &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/case-study-empowering-carbon-free-homes/"&gt;climate tech case study&lt;/a&gt;, a new &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/pdfs/Shovels_Climate.pdf"&gt;climate tech one-pager&lt;/a&gt;, and identified over 14,000 contractors with green rebate program affiliations (more on this next month!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First, a primer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new subscriber told me that she loves this newsletter (I mean, who wouldn't?) but that it's hard to pick up the story mid-stream. Since we're adding &amp;gt; 100 new subscribers every month, I figured she's not alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here's the plot so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shovels set out in Oct 2022 to make building permit data useful  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luka and Ryan raised some angel and pre-seed money in March 2023  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Petra joined us to boost our data engineering in May 2023  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We released our nationwide building permit API in August 2023  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We followed that with a nationwide building contractor API in Nov 2023  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Lost? Here's &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-v1-api/"&gt;what an API is&lt;/a&gt;)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then we launched &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-ai-gpt/"&gt;a custom GPT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-app/"&gt;a web app&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shovels.shovels1"&gt;a mobile app&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now we're making all ☝️ a lot better  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And Betty just joined to help me sell this stuff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thus, we need V2 feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/april-2024-newsletter/"&gt;last month's newsletter&lt;/a&gt; I described what V2 is all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, it's the killer building permit and building contractor app that doesn't exist in the market yet probably because it seems too obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to give you the ability to look at the permit queue in any jurisdiction, and the active permits on any contractor, and the permit history on any address. All in one killer app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a clickable prototype and before we really start building it, we'd love to watch you to try to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I get &lt;a href="https://shovels.pipedrive.com/scheduler/GXeGebUW/shovels-v2-prototype-test"&gt;15 mins of your time&lt;/a&gt;? What you'll get in return is influence, our gratitude, and some free Shovels data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the same sneak peak I shared last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Explore our permit data using our web app" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/explore.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From the Engineering desk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Shovels, we're on a mission to make our data dazzle by harnessing the coolest tech out there! We're excited to introduce our latest initiative: using Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve the tagging accuracy of permit records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficient Testing and Validation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our approach included a comprehensive evaluation of various LLMs, selecting the best fit for understanding and categorizing permit data. We are establishing a rigorous validation process, incorporating expert feedback to refine the model's accuracy through continuous iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalable Architecture for Future Growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our findings, we've been designing a scalable architecture that integrates with our systems and is equipped to handle future expansions. This ensures our capacity to manage and tag data efficiently as our operations grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-tagging and Expanding Tags&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will soon re-tag all existing permit records with this new system, doubling our tag categories! This expansion will enrich our dataset, offering more detailed insights and enhancing the value we deliver to our clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miscellanea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have implemented stricter validation rules for permit dates to address previously observed inaccuracies, such as implausible dates like "1900-01-01".   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added construction_duration which captures the time span between the issue and final date. The previous duration field is now called approval_duration.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We fixed issues where some permits did not have a status field set despite having a final_date value.   &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We resolved a bug affecting the grouping of contractors. Now contractors sharing the same phone number are accurately grouped together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: save humanity&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I subscribe to the notion that "Save the Planet" doesn't make much sense. The planet was fine before it was dominated by homo sapiens and it would be fine without us, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don't need to Save the Planet. We need to save ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month was Earth Month, punctuated by Earth Day on April 22. Much of the discussion was about the ocean currents that impact air temperature and weather events everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What contributes to warmer oceans? Greenhouse gases. And what contributes to greenhouse gases? Fossil fuels. And what accounts for a third of all fossil fuel consumption? Buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, heating air and water inside of buildings. This is why building permit data is &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/pdfs/Shovels_Climate.pdf"&gt;useful for climate tech&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's why we're working with &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/?category=Case%20Study"&gt;so many climate and construction companies&lt;/a&gt; who want to identify home and building owners who can level up to hyper efficient heat pumps to do the heating currently done by gas, oil, and propane appliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building permit data isn't perfect, but it's the best tool we've got. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This month we started rebuilding a few things. The results are exciting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We rebuilt and re-released our web application. You can check it out now at &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;https://app.shovels.ai&lt;/a&gt;. It just kinda needed to happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We rebuilt our &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/"&gt;API docs&lt;/a&gt; too. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of API, we added city to the &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/search_permits_description_v1_permits_search_get"&gt;permit search API&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/get_contractors_by_activity_city_v1_contractors_activity_city_get"&gt;contractor search API&lt;/a&gt; (and the &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;new app&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-zXFhOF8SP-shovels-ai"&gt;ShovelsGPT&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can now also search contractors by their license classification  ⚡️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We re-classified every building permit in Texas and the results are amazing. More details and the math behind this is below. The rest of the country is next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 million more permits and 1.3 million new geo-tagged addresses. We also added 19 new jurisdictions. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our big nationwide contractor license data project has begun. We're integrating all of the state contractor license files we can get our hands on. &lt;strong&gt;We're also including building electrification rebate program affiliations!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We've begun a big website rewrite project which you'll start to notice in the coming weeks and months. This just kinda needed to happen too. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Quick reminder&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are here to make building permit data useful. We're hearing from our customers that to be &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; we need to make permit data &lt;em&gt;insightful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's where we're headed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We post all of our newsletters on our blog. If you want the full recap on what's been going on at Shovels, you can &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/?category=Company"&gt;read them all here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Another new software build&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a good thing we like learning new software platforms. Cuz if we didn't... Man, I'd be in the wrong profession.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few newsletters back (&lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/february-2024-newsletter/"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;, to be exact) we launched the Shovels app. It was built in Flutter using FlutterFlow. That detail doesn't matter to 99% of you, but it mattered to me, because I picked it. The main benefit of Flutter is it's cross-platform; the same code lets us deploy to web, Android, and iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't know it at the time, but this compatibility leads to a lot of limitations. It was hard getting the web app to do what we wanted it to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, and this is where you come in, it became clear awfully fast that you don't care about mobile apps. And that meant my Flutter choice was the wrong one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of benefits to this exercise, though. Building our app, "dogfooding" our API, led to the changes you'll see in V2 (more about that &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/april-2024-newsletter/"&gt;in this newsletter&lt;/a&gt;). It also made us very comfortable decoupling the web framework from our data backend. We're leaning into that even more with our &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai/"&gt;brand new beta&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're using a fancy new front-end platform to build it. You'll feel the difference right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's still very much a beta, though. It's a step along the way to our V2 release with all of the new bells and whistles we've been talking about for months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, check out all these heat pumps in New York!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Explore our permit data using our web app" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/heat-pumps-in-ny.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick summary of the cool new stuff this release does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contractor contact info is now included in the CSV download.&lt;/strong&gt; On a Permit search, toggle on the Has Contractor? option under Contractor Filters. On a Contractor search, it's always included. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All permit details are included in the CSV download.&lt;/strong&gt; This used to be limited to just a few fields. Now it's not, so you get everything!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search permits by city.&lt;/strong&gt; Now you don't need to remember every zip code in every city! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Search contractors by city.&lt;/strong&gt; Ditto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An overall cleaner, faster experience.&lt;/strong&gt; You'll see. It just feels a lot better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;From the Engineering desk&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that software is only as good as the underlying data. That fact is not lost on us. Here's how we improved Shovels permit data last month.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permit database growth&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our total number of permits increased by 2 million, and we expanded our coverage to include 18 additional jurisdictions, along with 30,000 more contractors. In June, more than 400,000 new permits were filed that we are now tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better classifications using large language models (LLMs)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I could share exactly how we did this, but it's a bit of a trade secret at this point. In short, we tested a whole bunch of LLMs against an expert data annotation platform which served as ground truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By testing against human annotators, we could see how LLMs "think" about permit descriptions. We then optimized this process to bring down both the production time and its associated cost. We've landed in a really nice place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We classified every building permit Texas and have moved on to the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More geo-tagging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're using Esri (where we just joined &lt;a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/partners/our-partners/startups"&gt;their startup program&lt;/a&gt;!) to add 1.3 million geo-coordinates to our addresses, which helps reduce the gap of 3 million un-geocoded addresses. The remainder should be geocoded before next month's release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contractor state license files&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also next month -- more contractor contact information and building electrification rebate program affiliations. The data collection has been underway for some time and we're finally ready to merge it into production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: sell stuff to contractors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been taking a LOT of calls recently from companies that sell to building contractors (they also call them "vendors" or "companies" -- basically, orgs that build things) and they all say the same thing: &lt;strong&gt;finding info about contractors is hard&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, there's ZoomInfo but their firmographic info is static. Employee and revenue numbers don't tell you who does C&amp;amp;I or multifamily or SFH builds. It doesn't tell you where they build or their trades specialization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's where permits come in (with some help from state contractor license files!) Permits fill the void and make contractor databases come to life. We've been working on this for a year (from the start of Shovels, really) and are going to push HARD in the coming months to release a truly exceptional sales intelligence product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the big idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A website for every contractor (or darn close).&lt;/strong&gt; A contractor website domain is the key to joining all sorts of other databases into Shovels. We're going to give them to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contacts at contractors.&lt;/strong&gt; The phone and email address on the permit might not be the person you want to reach. We get it. We're building out our own B2B contractor contact database so you can reach deeper into the org. This will be available in both the web app and the API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clay integration.&lt;/strong&gt; To know &lt;a href="https://www.clay.com/"&gt;Clay&lt;/a&gt; is to love Clay. We're working with them on a native Shovels integration. This will be 🔥&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classifications and certifications.&lt;/strong&gt; If you want to filter by general contractor, electrician, or other special license, you'll be able to do that too. And we're even adding electrification rebate program affiliations for those of you working to save us from global warming. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're thrilled to be working with all of you. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category></entry><entry><title>July 2024 Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/july-2024-newsletter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-07-10T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-07-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-07-10:/blog/july-2024-newsletter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month's Shovels newsletter focuses on community engagement and significant updates.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This month's update is all about community!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have new partnerships. We have a public Discord server. On the data side, we're announcing a new coverage dashboard and a bunch of pipeline improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partnerships galore the last few weeks: We announced our &lt;a href="https://construction.autodesk.com/workflows/construction-software-integrations/shovels/"&gt;Autodesk integration&lt;/a&gt; and our participation in the &lt;a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/partners/our-partners/startups"&gt;Esri startup program&lt;/a&gt; -- we are moving geo-spatially into construction project management!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And another partnership: &lt;a href="https://deepsync.com/"&gt;Deep Sync&lt;/a&gt; for targeting homeowners with ads based on their permit history. I couldn't fit this one into the previous bullet. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We'll be at the &lt;a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/uc/overview"&gt;Esri User Conference&lt;/a&gt; in San Diego next week! Reply or join our Discord (see below) if you can meet up. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How about Austin in March 2025? We need ideas for a SXSW panel. We'll be your data partner. &lt;a href="https://panelpicker.sxsw.com/"&gt;Submissions are due&lt;/a&gt; on July 21.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of reaching out, you can now &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/Nypja3cKDx"&gt;chat us up on Discord&lt;/a&gt;. We launched a public server! &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/Nypja3cKDx"&gt;Hop into our Discord&lt;/a&gt; to chat with us about permits, contractors, data science, or the blink-182 summer concert tour (I went and it was EPIC 🤘)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our customers love our transparency. Here's a big heaping spoonful of it: We released a &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; detailed &lt;a href="https://shovels.metabaseapp.com/public/dashboard/0573503d-88ac-4ba4-a723-346b55de482b"&gt;Shovels Coverage Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. Now you can see exactly where we have (and don't have) building permit and contractor data! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our nationwide AI-driven permit classifications are available to our database and report customers. These are REALLY GOOD. I know because our most skeptical customers said so. We'll roll them out to the API and web app shortly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Quick reminder&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're getting this email because you reached out to us. We send one big newsletter each month. People seem to like it -- we have over 1,500 subscribers! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels exists to make building permit and contractor data useful. We're hearing from our customers that to be &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; we need to make permit data &lt;em&gt;insightful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's where we're headed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We post all of our newsletters on our blog. If you want the full recap on what's been going on at Shovels, you can &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/?category=Company"&gt;read them all here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Our thesis as a data insights company&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not the only company selling tons of building permit records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big guys like ATTOM and CoreLogic and smaller ones like BuildZoom and Construction Monitor have been doing this for 10+ years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sets us apart, and the whole reason we built Shovels in the shadow of these incumbents, is to &lt;strong&gt;make it easy&lt;/strong&gt; to get insights from building permit data.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it! We bring data coverage transparency, self-service options, an API with great documentation, a public data dictionary, seamless data lake transfers, and enthusiastic one-on-one support to a huge industry that (clearly) needs it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've learned from our customers that clean, reliable, ready-to-use data about what's getting built and who's doing it is very valuable. They want frequent updates, complete coverage, and lots of ways to filter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've learned from my team that doing all the above is hard. Very hard. Which is why, despite the long head start, the other guys haven't done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that is our thesis for being here, doing what we do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few highlights of what's coming this year: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jurisdiction profiles.&lt;/strong&gt; We're rolling permits and contractors up by jurisdiction to offer insights like permit approval and construction times by permit type. A clickable dashboard for (almost) every building permit office in the country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address profiles.&lt;/strong&gt; See every permit and contractor who worked on an address. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permit portfolios.&lt;/strong&gt; Organize groups of permits that you want to track in one place. This feature is particularly useful for brokers and contractors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permit inspection details.&lt;/strong&gt; Get the inspection history on a given permit to see how work is progressing. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permit review details.&lt;/strong&gt; Find out why permits get stuck in review and how long each review step usually takes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subcontractor relationships.&lt;/strong&gt; GCs usually work with the same subs. Many jurisdictions document it. We're bringing these valuable relationships to light. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are very excited about all of this! It still feels like we're just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;From the Engineering desk&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of the engineering tasks we finished last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Permit tagging&lt;/strong&gt;: Our new AI-enhanced tagging process is now active in the data pipeline, processing 120 million permits so far. This upgrade allows us to classify new permits more swiftly and efficiently, utilizing the latest AI methods to deliver industry-leading results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced address search&lt;/strong&gt;: We introduced a new &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/search_addresses_v1_addresses_search_get"&gt;address search API endpoint&lt;/a&gt;. It is designed to simplify free-form address search for our customers and provide normalized addresses that can be used in other API calls supporting address parameters. This update aims to improve the user experience when using our API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced contractor data handling&lt;/strong&gt;: Our contractor's dataset constantly evolves with new data and advanced data engineering techniques. To enable seamless customer integration, we now provide a full changelog detailing all changes from one month to the next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: make a coverage heat map&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With mapping on my mind, and a new coverage dashboard, I want to specifically call out our &lt;a href="https://shovels.metabaseapp.com/public/dashboard/0573503d-88ac-4ba4-a723-346b55de482b"&gt;new permit coverage heat map&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now have geo-coordinates on most of our permit addresses. We can bin these coordinates in 1 degree blocks to visualize our permit coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Explore our permit data using our web app" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/coverage.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may not look like much, but this represents a TON of hard work -- pulling data from thousands of jurisdictions into dozens of data pipelines and finally into a single database of 140M geotagged building permits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what I'm looking forward to talking about next week at the Esri conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you want to nerd out about it online, now you can &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/Nypja3cKDx"&gt;find us on Discord&lt;/a&gt; 🤓&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category></entry><entry><title>Shovels partners with Autodesk Construction Cloud</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/shovels-partners-with-autodesk-construction-cloud/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-09T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-08-09T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-08-09:/blog/shovels-partners-with-autodesk-construction-cloud/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shovels announces official integration partnership with Autodesk Construction Cloud, enabling ACC users to access nationwide permit data, track jurisdiction timelines, and identify development projects directly within their existing workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We had an exciting July here at Shovels. We added new customers, expanded our coverage, and found new use cases for our products. As part of our mission to make permit data useful, we constantly explore ways to integrate into the construction industry’s existing tools and systems –- and in July  we took a major step forward with Autodesk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shovels is now an &lt;a href="https://www.autodesk.com/blogs/construction/14-new-integrations-for-autodesk-construction-cloud/"&gt;official partner with Autodesk’s Construction Cloud&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autodesk’s Construction Cloud is a leading tool in the building industry, used by millions of architects, contractors, and subcontractors to design, oversee, and execute complex projects across the world. ACC has a web of integrations enabling its users to access all aspects of a given project in one central hub. On July 30th, Autodesk announced that Shovels would be one of 14 new integrations available in ACC, bringing our data closer to the people who can make the most use of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This partnership means Autodesk Construction Cloud users can now integrate with Shovels, enabling them to access permit data from across the country, track timelines within jurisdictions, and identify key projects in development. While our current customers are already leveraging Shovels to find qualified contractors, generate leads, and navigate permitting processes, we are eager to see the new applications that will emerge out of this exciting collaboration with one of the leaders in the construction software space!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before I get into the bullet points, I want to offer a brief sentimental reflection. It was a year ago, August 2023, in this very newsletter, that we announced our first API pricing plans. We've come a long way since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday I met with a HVAC software startup. They said how much they appreciate our fast API with self-serve keys, clean data, and great documentation. That's basically the nicest thing you could say to a guy like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They'll be a customer, alongside dozens of others paying us real money for permit and contractor data. One year in, Shovels is a real company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;August is our anniversary month, so I share this to say thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, enough looking backward -- here's what's coming up next!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will have a booth at &lt;a href="https://blueprintvegas.com/"&gt;Blueprint&lt;/a&gt; in Las Vegas from Sept 17-19. Find us and say hi!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We won't have a booth at &lt;a href="https://www.re-plus.com/"&gt;RE+&lt;/a&gt; in Anaheim on Sept 9-12, but we will be walking around and meeting a lot of people (and a few of our customers) who do have booths. Reach out if you'll be there!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We'll also be in NYC for some of &lt;a href="https://www.climateweeknyc.org/"&gt;Climate Week&lt;/a&gt; from Sept 22-29. Lots of climate capital and tech will converge there and we are ready for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For those of you new to this newsletter, don't forget to &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/Nypja3cKDx"&gt;find us on Discord&lt;/a&gt;. We're just getting started with our new online Shovels community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the tech front, we added &lt;em&gt;start_date&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;end_date&lt;/em&gt; to our database table shares and they'll launch in the API this week. It's a much better way to filter and query.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We added &lt;em&gt;primary_email&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;primary_phone&lt;/em&gt; to the contractors table. Many of you asked for this. We delivered!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also made more progress on contractor de-duplication. This will continue to be a work in progress -- and we will continue to be the very best at it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wireframes on our new and improved web application are &lt;strong&gt;DONE&lt;/strong&gt;. Let the building begin! Our new app is going to be awesome. I know this because of all the feedback you've given us on &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai/"&gt;the beta&lt;/a&gt;. We're still on track to release in &lt;strong&gt;mid-October&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can now merge permit data into geospatial files like parcels and census tracts. More on this site selection use case below!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, shout out to &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexkatzman/"&gt;Alex Katzman&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://growthinflection.com/"&gt;Growth Inflection&lt;/a&gt; for coming up with a phrase that you're going to see a lot more of: "shovel-ready data." Indeed, the difference between us and the others is just that: &lt;strong&gt;Our data is shovel-ready&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Quick reminder&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're getting this email because you reached out to us. We send one big newsletter each month. People seem to like it -- we have over 1,700 subscribers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels finds the value in local government data. We're focusing first on making building permit and contractor useful and accessible, but there's a ton of other data on the roadmap too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We post all of our newsletters on our blog. If you want the full recap on what's been going on at Shovels, you can  &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/?category=Company"&gt;read them all here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The hard thing about hard data&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month I mentioned a bunch of features that we'll release in the next quarter or two. You can  &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/july-2024-newsletter/"&gt;read the full list here&lt;/a&gt;  but I'll call out three of the ones that don't exist  &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; today:  &lt;strong&gt;permit review details&lt;/strong&gt;,  &lt;strong&gt;permit inspection details&lt;/strong&gt;, and  &lt;strong&gt;subcontractor relationships&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many jurisdictions provide this data, but it's buried deep in the "blob" of HTML that you get when you scrape the permit off the website. It's not included every time and the way that it's structured is prone to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the other guys don't even grab it. We have this data but we haven't gotten around to processing and parsing it yet. We know there will be a gazillion edge cases to resolve once we get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what makes hard data hard. It's also what makes the work we do valuable. I want Shovels to keep getting better at it, to be the  &lt;em&gt;very best&lt;/em&gt;, and to share what we find with the companies and organizations that need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about this a lot recently because Shovels, believe it or not, isn't just a building permit data company. It's where we're starting, and there is a LOT further to go down this rabbit hole, but at our core we are curious about all sorts of local government data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the expertise we're developing and the place we'll ultimately take among the pantheon of great data companies. I'm tremendously excited about this vision and look forward to writing many more newsletters about all of it 😬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That aside, let's get down to brass tacks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;From the Engineering desk&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're thrilled to share with you some exciting updates to our product! We've had our sleeves rolled up digging into your feedback and creating enhancements to provide you with an even better user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API /v1/addresses/search zip code ext bug:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve fixed a pesky bug tied to zip codes. If you have used the ext in the free-form search you didn’t get the expected results. Glitch fixed ✅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date-Related Additions:&lt;/strong&gt; We've got you covered when tracking timelines. We've defined &lt;code&gt;start_date&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end_date&lt;/code&gt; based on permit dates, additionally, you now have the &lt;code&gt;total_duration&lt;/code&gt; as the difference between these dates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primary Contact Info:&lt;/strong&gt; Keeping you connected! We have added primary phone and primary email fields to the contractors' dataset ensuring you have the best contact information on hand. No more long arrays!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Identification Features:&lt;/strong&gt; We've made some adjustments in business and individual names for clearer identification - no more puzzling over who's who!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deduplication Fixes:&lt;/strong&gt; To ensure the integrity of your data, we've implemented a fix to avoid duplicate entries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to creating a catering platform that serves your construction data needs in the most efficient way possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: choose a retail location&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me just say this first, because I had another idea for this part of the newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a heat pump water heater. For months I've been getting error alerts via its app on my phone. Compressor shutdown blah blah; I've been ignoring it because the hot water still works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How will I find a good contractor?&lt;/em&gt;  Ugh, I don't want to deal with this right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... 🙄 ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, last night I used Shovels to look up contractors who recently worked on heat pump water heaters in my zip code. I emailed three using the contact info we provide. One of them replied immediately. Michael is coming to my house tomorrow afternoon to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just thought that was cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's talk site selection!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're still stoked about our partnership with Esri. They opened up a bunch of doors into new business relationships and use cases for permit data. The one that keeps coming up is site selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture this: you're responsible for choosing the next ten locations for Chic-fil-A in Texas. How do you decide? You can use demographic data, plot competitors' locations, and map new home developments. All of that is helpful, but it's also pretty obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's not obvious? Looking where valued-add home renovations are trending. This signal shows which neighborhoods are investing locally, have disposable income, and likely to venture into downtown and try a new store or restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're coining a new term for this:  &lt;strong&gt;Neighborhood Vitality Index&lt;/strong&gt;, or NVI ("envy"). By rolling value-add renovation permits into points of interest, parcels, and census tracts, we can help companies map their next site locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to see for yourself?  &lt;a href="https://shovels.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=bcaed6407a4c47449ccc0769d9543c17"&gt;Here's our Esri map&lt;/a&gt;  of Dallas County!&lt;/p&gt;

WattCarbon provides a EAC (Energy Attribute Certificate) Marketplace to individuals and corporations alike. Both WattCarbon and Shovels help make climate-friendly and electrification projects accessible for all.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Summer ‘24 continues to heat up here at Shovels, with recently announced partnerships with &lt;a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/partners/our-partners/startups"&gt;Esri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shovels_shovels-integration-autodesk-construction-activity-7216433428143955968-6c-C"&gt;Autodesk&lt;/a&gt;. Those are important commercial relationships. Today we’re announcing a partnership that’s meaningful for a different reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our two-fold mission — making permit data useful AND supporting climate-friendly tech and initiatives — meant that we have a perfect opportunity to partner with &lt;a href="https://www.wattcarbon.com/"&gt;WattCarbon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.wattcarbon.com/p/shovels-and-wattcarbon-join-forces"&gt;Read the WattCarbon announcement blog post here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WattCarbon is a key player in the nascent EAC (&lt;a href="https://blog.wattcarbon.com/p/what-are-the-benefits-of-eacs"&gt;Energy Attribute Certificate&lt;/a&gt;) Marketplace, aggregating different vendors and clean energy projects into one platform. They make it easy to invest in the kinds of climate-saving industries like solar arrays, wind farms, heat pumps, and many more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we partnered with WattCarbon to set aside and invest a percentage of our quarterly revenue into their OpenEAC Exchange. Our US building permit dataset makes it easy to find contractors ready to work on any kind of climate-friendly or electrification projects, and we want to support this type of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2023 we started &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/growth-of-ev-charging-in-california/"&gt;a series analyzing EV charger construction&lt;/a&gt; trends, and found that there’s still a lot of room to grow. Adoption of other electrification projects, especially heat pumps, are lagging behind solar and wind energy. However, investing in EACs with WattCarbon will finally allow decarbonization efforts (instead of only carbon-free projects) to be included in the bigger picture, and drive those numbers up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href="https://www.wattcarbon.com/"&gt;WattCarbon&lt;/a&gt; to see how you can get involved with EACs, and &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/contact"&gt;reach out to us&lt;/a&gt; to talk more about this partnership and how Shovels supports electrification projects all over the country. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="EAC"></category><category term="WattCarbon"></category><category term="Decarbonization"></category></entry><entry><title>Shovels 101: Finding Address Permit History</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/shovels-101-finding-address-permit-history/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-08-29T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-11-04T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Alex Brown</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-08-29:/blog/shovels-101-finding-address-permit-history/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Shovels API gives you insight into permit history by per address. Users can follow these three steps to retrieve this information. This data can help with contractor and jurisdiction analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Understanding a property’s permit history is critical to any project. Whether you’re researching a new property to acquire, or double-checking what previous owners have done to one you already own, it’s important info to have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/"&gt;Shovels API&lt;/a&gt; in your toolbox, finding permits specific to a given address is a breeze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Authentication and Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t already have a &lt;strong&gt;Shovels Web App&lt;/strong&gt; account (welcome!), then head over and setup a &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;Free Trial&lt;/a&gt;. Go to the &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; page to get your API Key, read over our API Docs, and open your preferred terminal, shell, or editor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a more in-depth introduction to using our API, please check out our blog post guide on &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/how-to-use-the-shovels-api/"&gt;How to use the Shovels API&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide will assume a basic familiarity with cURL, JSON parsing, and our API schema. Example query snippets will use cURL, but our API docs have examples in a variety of other languages too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the Shovels API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set the scene, imagine that you’re a prospective buyer wanting to do your due diligence on an intriguing property. The building was constructed in the last 15 years, and it’s important to you that the previous owners have kept everything above board with the required permits and inspections handled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Shovels API, you can get from address to detailed permit history based on the jurisdiction’s own books with three API calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Finding the Address&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/search_addresses_v1_addresses_search_get"&gt;GET Search Addresses&lt;/a&gt;  endpoint, search for the address to confirm that there are any permits on record (our system goes back ~20 years). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sample query, for a “123 Main St”, should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//api.shovels.ai/v1/addresses/search?q=123%20MAIN%ST&amp;#39; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;: Remember to use &lt;code&gt;%20&lt;/code&gt; to denote any spaces in the address string, and that the correct endpoint here is &lt;em&gt;/addresses/&lt;/em&gt;, NOT ~~/address/~~.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming your other syntax and API key is input correctly, this request should return the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;[
    {
        &amp;quot;street_no&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;123&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;street&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;MAIN ST&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;city&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ST. FRANCISVILLE&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;zip_code&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;12345&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;zip_code_ext&amp;quot;:null,
        &amp;quot;state&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;LA&amp;quot;
    },
    {
        &amp;quot;street_no&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;123&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;street&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;SO MAIN ST&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;city&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ST. ALBANS&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;zip_code&amp;quot;:null,
        &amp;quot;zip_code_ext&amp;quot;:null,
        &amp;quot;state&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;VT&amp;quot;
    },
    {
        &amp;quot;street_no&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;123&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;street&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;MAIN ST&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;city&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;NACOGDOCHES&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;zip_code&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;75961&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;zip_code_ext&amp;quot;:null,
        &amp;quot;state&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;TX&amp;quot;
    },
    {
        &amp;quot;street_no&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;123&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;street&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;MAIN ST&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;city&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;AGAWAM&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;zip_code&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;01001&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;zip_code_ext&amp;quot;:null,
        &amp;quot;state&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;MA&amp;quot;
    },
    {
        &amp;quot;street_no&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;123&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;street&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;MAIN ST&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;city&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;HOPKINTON&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;zip_code&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;02804&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;zip_code_ext&amp;quot;:null,
        &amp;quot;state&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;RI&amp;quot;
    }
]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The returned list of addresses is ordered by relevance and formatted according to USPS standard. In this case, of all the matching addresses in the US, &lt;strong&gt;five of them have relevant permit histories&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick which address you want to dig deeper into, and &lt;strong&gt;proceed to step 2&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Permit availability rates can vary drastically for a number of reasons (offline or infrequently uploaded records, isn’t yet in our jurisdiction &lt;a href="https://shovels.metabaseapp.com/public/dashboard/0573503d-88ac-4ba4-a723-346b55de482b?city=&amp;amp;county_or_jurisdiction=&amp;amp;state=&amp;amp;tab=133-permit-types&amp;amp;zip_code="&gt;Coverage Map&lt;/a&gt;, or many others). If your desired address isn’t included, then please reach out to us at &lt;a href="mailto:support@shovels.ai"&gt;support@shovels.ai&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll take a look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Retrieve Permits for the Address&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the data returned in Step 1, we will now retrieve the exact permits themselves for the desired address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/get_permits_by_address_v1_permits_address_get"&gt;GET Permits by Address&lt;/a&gt; endpoint, enter the relevant address data to the next query. The list of required parameters are noted in the schema on the API doc linked just above. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, a sample query, for “123 Main St, Agawam, MA 01001”, would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//api.shovels.ai/v1/permits/address?street_no=123&amp;amp;street=MAIN%20ST&amp;amp;state=MA&amp;amp;city=AGAWAM&amp;amp;zip_code=01001&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;: The multiple parameters required for this endpoint are noted with the AND &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second request should return the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
    &amp;quot;items&amp;quot;:
    [
        &amp;quot;5c4015a630e941b6&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;0eb49a17aa7e8791&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;77d2073b694190dd&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;cd66d9dda0662b59&amp;quot;,
        &amp;quot;5575716497ab9bd6&amp;quot;
    ],
    &amp;quot;page&amp;quot;:1,
    &amp;quot;size&amp;quot;:5,
    &amp;quot;next_page&amp;quot;:null
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which shows that there are 5 permits on record for this address. These Permit IDs are unique to the Shovels platform, but can be used to retrieve the detailed permit details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so, &lt;strong&gt;proceed to Step 3&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Return Detailed Permit History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#operation/get_permits_by_id_v1_permits_get"&gt;GET Permits by ID&lt;/a&gt; endpoint, you can search for a single (or string array) of permit IDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this sample, to request the first permit payload would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -i -X GET &amp;#39;https://api.shovels.ai/v1/permits?id=5c4015a630e941b6&amp;#39; 
    -H &amp;#39;X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&amp;#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;: Searching for multiple permits at once requires a string &lt;strong&gt;array&lt;/strong&gt;, which is denoted in the cURL request by the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;id=string&lt;/code&gt; clause for each additional permit ID. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third request for the single permit should return the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;5c4015a630e941b6&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Replace existing 12&amp;#39; x 14&amp;#39; deck with a 20&amp;#39; x 20&amp;#39; deck (estimated cost $8,000), zone res a2, receipt  No.58233&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;number&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;17961&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;jurisdiction&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Agawam Town&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;job_value&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;subtype&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Building permit - new&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there you have it! This information can be exported for whatever outside needs you have, and this process can be easily repeated for any addresses and permits needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same information is searchable via our Web App at https://app.shovels.ai/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For enterprise-level usage, get our full dataset with deeper insights, dashboards, and flat files. However you need to retrieve this data, we’ll make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Troubleshooting Tips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A full list of our error codes are described in our API docs &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/#section/API-Details"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Most errors are 404s, which frequently mean either the address is input incorrectly, or there isn’t a permit record on file to match the search terms.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are able to find the correct address in our &lt;strong&gt;Web App&lt;/strong&gt;, then double check the syntax of the request. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you run into any other questions, please email us at &lt;a href="mailto:support@shovels.ai"&gt;support@shovels.ai&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll help you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope this guide is helpful (and we’ve got more on the way). Our API is meant to be intuitive and easy to use, so we definitely want to know any and all hiccups you encounter. If there’s an endpoint that we don’t support yet, or any other feedback for our platform, we’d love to hear it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re building out Shovels API v2 right now, and your requests might make the next release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Building!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Customer Success"></category><category term="api"></category></entry><entry><title>Shovels 101: Permit Statuses</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/shovels-101-permit-statuses/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-03T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-09-03T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alex Brown</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-09-03:/blog/shovels-101-permit-statuses/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Shovels ecosystem breaks down construction permit status based on jurisdiction regulation and construction cycles. Permits can be In Review, Active, Final, or Inactive. Users can investigate permit status via Shovels to analyze wider trends in contractor performance and jurisdiction activity.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Permits are hard enough to acquire on their own, so we want to take the confusion out of understanding a permit’s status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our mission to make permit data as clean and straightforward as possible, let’s quickly review Permit Statuses and how they map from our ecosystem to the actual construction process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Permit Status Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Flowchart describing Shovels permit status lifecycle, going from &amp;quot;In Review&amp;quot; to a cycle of &amp;quot;Active&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Inactive&amp;quot;, ending with &amp;quot;Final&amp;quot;" src="/images/permit-status-flowchart.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Shovels ecosystem, there are &lt;strong&gt;four&lt;/strong&gt; statuses that Permits can be in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;in_review&lt;/code&gt;: From the moment the permit is filed with the local jurisdiction, until it is approved. This is defined by the &lt;code&gt;file_date&lt;/code&gt;  object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;active&lt;/code&gt;: From the moment the permit is approved, until project completion or some other intermediate restriction. This is defined by the &lt;code&gt;issue_date&lt;/code&gt;  object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt;: When the permit is completed, and submitted back to the jurisdiction upon job completion. This is defined by the &lt;code&gt;final_date&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;inactive&lt;/code&gt;: If any part of the process stalls or gets restricted from progression, then the permit status moves to &lt;code&gt;inactive&lt;/code&gt;. Disqualifying reasons and reporting time will vary by jurisdiction and local regulation, but can include failing to meet project inspections, the permit may expire before completion or &lt;a href="https://ecode360.com/6567722#6567722"&gt;inactivity for more than 6 months (180 days)&lt;/a&gt;, and many others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more system definitions (beyond permit statuses), check out our &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qiIxx37_-6vGfGp2i5pXv4w2FdsLsShjCqSVO5v6OMQ/edit?gid=249471341#gid=249471341"&gt;Data Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve got the definitions out of the way, let’s put them into practice with a sample project timeline. We’ll add in the relevant variables and objects that our system uses to track the permit progress where relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“John and Jane Doe remodeled their house in Agawam, MA and contracted out the work to a local contractor, Acme Construction, LLC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acme Construction, LLC have gathered all the paperwork and due diligence for the project, and are submitting the permit to the local jurisdiction, the Hampden County Building Department. They receive their permit number and file date, and in the next few days, this permit will show up in the Shovels database as &lt;code&gt;in_review&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;file_date&lt;/code&gt; would be &lt;strong&gt;2022-05-02&lt;/strong&gt; (May 4th, 2023), for those keeping track at home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few weeks later, Acme Construction, LLC’s permit for single-family residence remodel is approved, and they’re cleared to begin construction. Great news, and now, their corresponding permit will show as &lt;code&gt;active&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;issue_date&lt;/code&gt; would be &lt;strong&gt;2022-05-26&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;approval_time&lt;/code&gt; would be 24 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 months in to the project, and Acme Construction, LLC has made huge progress. However, they didn’t pass one of their inspections, and aren’t able to resume work until that underlying issue has been fixed. When this data is submitted to the jurisdiction alongside their permit files, the Shovels database will now classify this permit as &lt;code&gt;inactive&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provisional &lt;code&gt;construction_duration&lt;/code&gt; would be calculated from &lt;code&gt;issue_date&lt;/code&gt; to the date of the failed inspection (&lt;strong&gt;2023-01-29&lt;/strong&gt;), as 250 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 months later, and Acme Construction, LLC has fixed the issue and passed their inspection. Once updated with the HC Building Dept, this permit will return to active.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Construction resumes on &lt;strong&gt;2023-07-29&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;code&gt;construction_duration&lt;/code&gt; count will now continue, until project completion. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7 months later, and everything is completed! All inspections have been passed, and John and Jane have their new remodeled house all ready to move back in. Once that paperwork is completed, then the Shovels database will show the permit as &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;final_date&lt;/code&gt; would be &lt;strong&gt;2024-02-29&lt;/strong&gt;, with a &lt;code&gt;total_duration&lt;/code&gt; of 664 days, and &lt;code&gt;construction_duration&lt;/code&gt; of 465 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data points can be extremely helpful for further analysis of jurisdiction and contractor efficiency. For instance, Acme Construction, LLC’s work for Mr. and Mrs. Doe’s remodel could be compared against other remodel jobs they’ve done in the past, or even against other contractors with the same licensing and job types. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, jurisdiction’s approval times can be compared based on job type or seasonal application windows, which may give further insight into developmental opportunities in that region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibilities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permit Status is an important data point to everyone involved in the construction and proptech industries, and we want to make sure that our system is as easy to understand as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shovels 101&lt;/strong&gt; will be our tutorial series, and we've got a bunch of topics lined up for future publication. If there's anything you want us to cover, further questions about permit statuses, or any other fields in our dataset, let us know at &lt;a href="mailto:support@shovels.ai"&gt;support@shovels.ai&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

In this blog, we discuss solar construction specifically due to the RE+ clean energy convention. Use Shovels to inform your construction company's business models and strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.re-plus.com/"&gt;RE+&lt;/a&gt; is the largest and most comprehensive clean energy conference in the United States. In honor of it’s 20th Anniversary, we’re publishing some insights we’ve gleaned from our datasets and models here at Shovels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(By the way, if you’re reading at the time of publication, we’re at RE+ in Anaheim right now! Come find us on the floor, or reach out directly to coordinate — we want to meet you!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar tech, and clean energy tech generally, is something we’re really passionate about. We’ve recently &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/shovels-partners-with-wattcarbon/"&gt;partnered with WattCarbon&lt;/a&gt; to support their decarbonization efforts via their new Energy Attribute Certificate (EAC) Marketplace, and also worked with &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/case-study-empowering-carbon-free-homes/"&gt;Carbon Free Homes&lt;/a&gt; to improve their climate-friendly contractor matching platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But today, we’re shining a light on solar construction trends thus far in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Shovels Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone new here (welcome!), we’ll give a quick refresher on what we do. Shovels is a building insights company, and we aggregate, normalize, and make construction data useful. It started at building permits, but we’re expanding into more robust models by incorporating contractor profiles, tax assessor files, and other publicly accessible data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, we can query, filter, and summarize the data any which way you like: by market, geo-region, or address; by permit type or fields, by contractors, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For today’s analysis, we’re going to be querying our model based on two key filters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permits filed this year; or &lt;code&gt;file_date = 2024%&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solar-inclusive projects (anything that includes solar technology); or &lt;code&gt;solar = true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Fields like these, along with other variables used in our model, can be reviewed in our &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qiIxx37_-6vGfGp2i5pXv4w2FdsLsShjCqSVO5v6OMQ/edit?gid=1818227349#gid=1818227349"&gt;Data Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can dig deeper than those to get into specifics of things like &lt;strong&gt;Contractor Availability&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Average Approval Time&lt;/strong&gt; later on, but for now these two filters will serve as the foundation of this dataset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are solar projects all over the country, it’s clear that the vast majority of activity is here in California, so let’s take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spotlight on California&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California has led the nation in solar adoption and technology for decades now, and part of that adoption is the widespread governmental support in the forms of &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/home-improvement/solar/california-solar-incentives/"&gt;incentives, tax credits, and rebates&lt;/a&gt;. So it makes sense that The Golden State continues to outpace everyone else in the push towards net-zero emissions and clean energy production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filtering the dataset above once again — by &lt;code&gt;state = CA&lt;/code&gt; — and sorting by geo-coordinates &lt;code&gt;lat&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;, we can see a heat map of this year’s construction volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Map of California with heatmap showing volume of solar project permits, by geographical coordinates." src="/images/digging-in-ca-solar-construction-heatmap-watermarked.png"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hubs like Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, and others in the Central Valley show the most activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, tax incentives aren’t the entire picture. The state-wide building permit pipeline is a well-oiled machine. Experienced contractors and administrative support makes filing your permit easy, which results in an astounding 6.15 day average approval time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidenote: to be fair to the other states, some are performaing just as well if not better than California (eg, NY with an average of 2.8 days), yet none come even close to the permit volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More impressively, the hotspots above have even better approval times, with San Diego County leading the way with a blistering 1.79 day average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a reminder, this is across all projects which include solar installation of any kind, so small panels on your personal home are counted in line with massive commercial construction that cover their roofs with solar arrays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your local jurisdiction wants to up their pace and adoption rates for solar- or other green-energy technologies, California is a good place to emulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Insights, In Season&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metrics like &lt;strong&gt;Permit Volume&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Average Approval Time&lt;/strong&gt; can be nice pats-on-the-back, but the real power of the Shovels model is trend and market gap analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the model we’ve refined already, let’s tweak it slightly to get a historical view of the past 4 years. If we adjust the original filter to &lt;code&gt;file_date = 202%&lt;/code&gt; (to cover everything built since January 2020), we can see the construction trends and seasonalities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is one such query, visualized and sorted by &lt;code&gt;month&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Area line graph showing California permit volume for solar projects since January 2020, by month." src="/images/digging-in-ca-solar-construction-trend-2020s-watermarked.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are seasonal spikes before and after Summer, with the biggest peak to date in March 2023 with a staggering 33k+ solar-inclusive project permits filed that month alone. This graph illustrates the duality of man, or at least those who installed their solar panels in advance versus those who regret not getting them up earlier that Spring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trendline here shows that things are slowing down, but only in comparison to the previous years’ highs. Using other construction data to determine solar saturation and wider construction trends in your specific market, Shovels could provide actionable insights into timing and lead-gen opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe other green technologies like &lt;a href="https://techcleanca.com/"&gt;heat pumps&lt;/a&gt; are relatively underrated, and ripe for a strong market push?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free Shovels Advice&lt;/strong&gt;: if you’re a solar supplier or in a solar-adjacent market, now would be &lt;strong&gt;a very good time&lt;/strong&gt; to confirm those outbound pipelines are fired up to prepare for the early Fall installation push. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels has in-depth contractor profiles and data that you could use for that very purpose — &lt;a href="mailto:sales@shovels.ai"&gt;reach out today&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivative metrics that can inform projections and trends are the name of the game, and a core tenet of the Shovels model and datasets. While solar construction is close-to-heart, we cover all range of project types — if it requires a building permit (and the jurisdiction digitizes their records), then we’ll have it for consumption. If we don't, let us know and we'll get it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was wonderful to shake hands and say hi in Anaheim and Las Vegas. If you missed us this year, you'll have another chance to meet us in September 2025. We're definitely going back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as promised to those we met at Blueprint, send an email to &lt;a href="mailto:sales@shovels.ai"&gt;sales@shovels.ai&lt;/a&gt; to get  &lt;strong&gt;two months free&lt;/strong&gt; on a  &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;  annual plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write this on a short reprieve from travel. This week is Climate Week in NYC and the meeting calendar is packed. Then I return and do a final product and marketing push before the launch of our new API and web app!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-awaited V2 is finally happening. That and more are described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You're building cool stuff with our API. We can see the pings but we don't really know what you're doing. Please &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/FWZiYni8DvURC5nD6"&gt;share your projects&lt;/a&gt; with us and we'll tell the whole world about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of API projects, we're also thinking about organizing a hackathon. If YOU have an API you want participants to consider using alongside Shovels, please reply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;V2 is launching next month. It's all-out sprint time over here. Nobody is sleeping. It's chaos. (Just kidding, we're way too on top of things for that 😌)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A sales and marketing wizard named &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordancrawford/"&gt;Jordan Crawford&lt;/a&gt; led a phenomenal livestream using Shovels API and Clay. View all &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF2t9qbBUDo"&gt;FIVE FREAKING HOURS of it here&lt;/a&gt;. If you're a sales nerd, this is your jam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can now run ads based on building permit history!&lt;/strong&gt; One of our partners has connected the dots between The Trade Desk (TTD), LiveRamp, and other partners with Shovels building permit data and it is LIVE. (This might become a very very big deal.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington, D.C. is live, too! 🎩&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And we hired two amazing people: &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-brown-9a4b0b19a/"&gt;Alex Brown&lt;/a&gt; is our support and writing guru and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/whitney-house/"&gt;Whitney House&lt;/a&gt; will help us with sales!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Quick reminder&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're getting this email because you reached out to us. We send one big newsletter each month. People seem to like it -- we now have over 2,300 subscribers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels transforms building permit data into actionable insights about contractors, homeowners, and market trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We post all of our newsletters on our blog. If you want the full recap on what's been going on at Shovels, you can  &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/?category=Company"&gt;read them all here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Our three-layer cake: contractor, homeowner, and market intelligence&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something about answering the question, "So what does Shovels do?" about a million and a half times over four weeks that forces some introspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like, yea man... What  &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any startup, the nuances of this answer waft about like leaves in the fall (just ask my bay trees). Investors push us one way; customers pull us another. I've been watching the leaves fall and this is where they've landed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels transforms building permit data into actionable insights about  &lt;strong&gt;contractors&lt;/strong&gt;,  &lt;strong&gt;homeowners&lt;/strong&gt;, and  &lt;strong&gt;market trends&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll briefly describe each and share what it means for the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contractor intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how most of you found Shovels. You recognized that ZoomInfo and LinkedIn have little useful data about building contractors. Google Maps, Yelp, and state license files can't tell you who's active or where they actually take jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written about this many times, so I won't do it again. Shovels is going to be the best (or maybe we're already the best?) at compiling and distributing firmographic data about building contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This hard work goes on and on and on. (And on and on.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homeowner intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer of you come to us for homeowner intel but I think this will change soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're SUPER EXCITED about our partnership with a DIGITAL ADVERTISING PARTNER who has ticked and tied our building permit data into The Trade Desk, LiveRamp, and a handful of other DSPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can target digital audiences based on deterministic homeowner purchase intent data... FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to target folks remodeling their kitchen? ✅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New homeowners who want to install solar? ✅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who need new appliances? ✅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibilities are endless. You can also still use us to get lists for SMS, phone, email, and direct mail campaigns, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Shovels will predict the future. We'll say what's going to happen based on building permit trends and other signals. We need to open up some engineering cycles to do this, but it's on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, we can roll up permits into census tracts and neighborhoods and do things like the  &lt;strong&gt;Neighborhood Vitality Index&lt;/strong&gt;  (NVI) which I've written about previously. This concept played really well at Blueprint and I'm looking forward to getting our first NVI customer in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;From the Engineering desk: V2 is coming!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's all V2, all the time now. And we are very excited to release this new and improved experience to all of our customers. We've been thinking about this for a year prepping for it for a couple of quarters, and implementing it for the last two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we're getting ready to release!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the other projects keep running too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;🚀 New Features&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even more contractor de-duplication so you see the full history on your contractor lookups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington, DC is now live 🎩!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;🔮 Coming Soon&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New UI designs based on wireframes for our Shovels Online app (see below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;API V2 scaffolding in the works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transformation and ingestion of 35 additional data sources for more comprehensive contractor information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Shovels Online V2 login screen" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/login-v2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're excited to show this to the world next month!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: run online ads&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever run a Google or Facebook ad campaign? You can run ads for just about any audience segment: puppy lovers, hair extension users, and Raiders fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One segment you can't run is home remodelers, general contractors, or solar panel  &lt;em&gt;owners&lt;/em&gt;  (only maybe that they visited a solar company website).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not an ad tech guy. I still don't know the difference between a DSP and an SSP. Fortunately, we have an expert here with us and she happens to run basically all of our commercial business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betty Wan knows ad tech and when I first started playing with this idea on LinkedIn, she reached out. An investor we both know ended up making a bunch of intros to companies that are in the bowels of the ad tech machinery and after many months of meetings, we have finally crossed the chasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shared above, our Shovels audience segments are LIVE. Meaning, like, you can run ads TODAY against Shovels data. To start, we have three audiences:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumers who are homeowners of single-family houses in the United States and who have an older HVAC system (defined as &amp;gt;8 years old based on industry benchmarks).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumers who are homeowners of single-family houses in the United States and who have a newer HVAC system (defined as &amp;lt;5 years old based on industry benchmarks).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consumers who are homeowners of single-family houses in the United States and who have older appliances (&amp;gt;8 years old based on industry benchmarks).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's so cool about this is we can slice this up in a million different ways. We only chose these three because we have a big (BIG!) box store interested in testing this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; be the next customer? Let us know!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category></entry><entry><title>Unlocking Shovels's Potential with Prolific</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/unlocking-shovelss-potential-with-prolific/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-09-26T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-09-29T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alex Brown</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-09-26:/blog/unlocking-shovelss-potential-with-prolific/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Shovels data engineering team partnered with Prolific to crowdsource data analysis experts. These experts helped to curate and categorize messy permit data into an organized sample. Shovels used this sample to train their LLM models to unlock their entire data pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, we partnered with &lt;a href="https://www.prolific.com/"&gt;Prolific&lt;/a&gt; to leverage their crowdsourced data analyst experts to help our engineers wrangle the messy and disjointed dataset that is US building permits. The Prolific team was an immense help, and in hindsight, we couldn’t have done it without them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re curious about the specifics, &lt;strong&gt;check out their case study on Shovels &lt;a href="https://www.prolific.com/resources/how-shovels-found-high-skilled-annotators-for-data-labeling-with-prolific-s-specialist-participants"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scalability is Key&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data engineers (shout out to Luka and Petra 🦾) are some of the best in the business, but even they couldn’t handle the curation of a classification model to accurately handle 200 million permits by themselves. It was possible, but wasn’t time- or cost-effective. Which was where Prolific came in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prolific’s vast network of data analysts meant that we could source multiple teams of construction experts to help us curate a golden sample of permit classification (tagging each by work type, address, location, and many more) to serve as the basis of our LLM training data. We’d known that the key to effective LLM and AI usage is all in the proprietary training data, so a human touch (many of them, in fact) was crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Data Speaks for Itself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing the results of the independent expert teams and their direct classification scores, we were able to create a highly accurate and effective training model. With that foundation in place, we brought it into our marquee data pipeline to handle the hundreds of millions of building permits we have (with more added every week).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our classification and data cleaning in place, our business intelligence trifecta — on homeowners, on contractors, and on the wider construction market — is “shovel-ready”. In fact, our &lt;strong&gt;Web App&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;API&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Data Feeds&lt;/strong&gt; are already in use across both small businesses and enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

Variance between local requirements and enforcement means that not all projects require permits. Available digitization of permits makes it even more complicated, but Shovels has a plan keep improving data completeness.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you want an accurate picture of what’s been done to a property, it makes sense to look at the permit history. Theoretically, any project of reasonable size — a kitchen remodel, a new roof, a plug-in EV Charger install — would have some level of sign-off from the city or local jurisdiction, right? It’s up to the government to ensure that construction is done in a safe and legal manner, with inspections and approvals before work even begins as well as prior to completion. There should be a paper trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s that bureaucratic red tape that can bog down a project in it’s infancy, especially for understaffed permit departments. It’s not that your paperwork is out of order, there’s just too long of a queue. In some areas, you’d be free to do the work yourself; in others, work done without a permit can mean a hefty fine and teardown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, it all comes down to the local building code. And if we know anything about local regulations, the variance from town to town can be extreme. This is the core of our problem. &lt;strong&gt;There are no standardized rules nationwide that mandate which work does or does not require a permit&lt;/strong&gt;. And even if there were, enforcement is another issue entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building Codes and Regulations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider a homeowner in Agawam, MA that is interested in upgrading their heating solution. Their old furnace finally gave out last winter, and they want to install a new heat pump to handle this winter’s cold and next summer’s heat, all from the same unit. The homeowner considers themselves a handyman, so could he do the installation alone, without a permit? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the State of Massachusetts, that answer is unfortunately &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;. According to the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/780-cmr-ninth-edition-base-code-chapter-1-scope-and-administration-amendments/download"&gt;building code&lt;/a&gt; (Section 105.2 of the 780 CMR (Code of Massachusetts Regulations)), which the Town of Agawam has adopted wholesale, a permit is required for this new install. The list of exempted projects is small, especially compared to some jurisdictions in some rural Texas counties, that might not have any permitting required at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second issue, briefly mentioned above, regards enforcement. In all likelihood, this homeowner could install their own heat pump in secrecy, and no one would even know until the property was sold and the new buyer arranges a house inspection. Even where permits are required, the jurisdiction record office will never have a complete accounting of projects done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(To be clear, Shovels &lt;strong&gt;does not&lt;/strong&gt; endorse such rogue construction. Always consult your local permit department for guidance on which projects you can DIY and which ones you need paperwork for.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variety of permit regulations across jurisdictions means that some areas will have more permits on file than others, even if equal numbers of equivalent projects were completed. From us at Shovels, we can only provide data on filed permits. And even then, only if those permits have been digitized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Permit Digitization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The permits themselves are usually kept by either the local permit department or the County Clerk office. The forms are usually paper, but sometimes they’re submitted online. In many cases, the paper forms are later digitized and uploaded for public online access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the jurisdictions will also upload their historical records. This can vary even more widely, but for the most part, we generally have ~20 years of permits, where available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These digitized permit records (and the insights gleaned from them) are what Shovels delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, digitization efforts and timelines vary dramatically (sensing a pattern yet?) from one jurisdiction to another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, there are multiple hurdles we have to overcome to access digitized permit data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permit Requirements — does the jurisdiction require a permit for this type of project?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulation Adherence — how capable is the jurisdiction in enforcing that projects have the required permits?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permit Digitization — how quick is the jurisdiction about uploading their filed permits for online access? How many years of permit history have they uploaded?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason that few providers are able to effectively deliver these records and insights. Permit data is a mess, and it takes a ton of effort to parse, clean, and categorize it all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we love a challenge, so we remain undaunted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Is Shovels Doing About It?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We knew that permit data was messy when we got into this business, so we have spent the vast majority of our codebase, engineering resources, and brainstorming power on how to solve this problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without getting into either the weeds or our secret sauce, we have three ongoing projects to improve the quantity and quality of our available permit data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve the training and quality of our proprietary LLMs (read more about how we built these &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/unlocking-shovelss-potential-with-prolific/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) — this will help us improve the timeliness of our delivery. The faster we can get the permits cleaned and our datasets updated, the fresher the insights. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance our relationships with local jurisdiction permitting offices to increase digitization with direct records requests — this will help us target specific jurisdictions with lower-than-usual digitization rates. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve our personal transparency with what data we have and what we don’t — check out our &lt;a href="https://shovels.metabaseapp.com/public/dashboard/0573503d-88ac-4ba4-a723-346b55de482b?tab=36-summary&amp;amp;state=&amp;amp;city=&amp;amp;county_or_jurisdiction=&amp;amp;zip_code=&amp;amp;date_filter="&gt;Coverage Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; to see a high-level view of what we have today. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With every data refresh (which will increase to weekly soon!), we strive to get closer and closer to the truly available permit data ceiling. More permits are filed every day, and more jurisdictions increase their digitization efforts, so that end is in sight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get Started Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We pride ourselves, here at Shovels, on being the best of the bunch when it comes to refining permit data into business intelligence.

A launch party is scheduled for October 24 in San Francisco!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;🚀 It's launch month here at Shovels! 🚀&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels Online is under &lt;em&gt;heavy&lt;/em&gt; development now. The hammers are swinging. The chainsaws are revving. Data dust is flying everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're slated to launch at the end of the month! We want to celebrate and you're invited to the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More below! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Come to &lt;a href="https://lu.ma/bsst1m5f"&gt;our launch party&lt;/a&gt; in downtown SF at 5pm on Oct 24! We can only really let 50 people into the penthouse suite at The Avery, so please check your calendars &lt;a href="https://lu.ma/bsst1m5f"&gt;and RSVP&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here's another big thing: &lt;strong&gt;contractor website domains&lt;/strong&gt;. Inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF2t9qbBUDo"&gt;Jordan's crazy hackathon&lt;/a&gt; last month, we went and got this done. Now it's 10X easier to add more contact info for each contractor you find in Shovels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ad stuff is pretty cool too. We're about to go online with another data partner, putting more building permit-based homeowner segments out there for targeting. Holler if you want info on that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had our fastest monthly batch process ever. Massive kudos to the Shovels Engineering squad (still just a team of 2) for processing 150 million permits in just 24 hours. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Quick reminder&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're getting this email because you reached out to us. We send one big newsletter each month. People seem to like it -- we now have over 3,000 subscribers! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels transforms building permit data into actionable insights about contractors, homeowners, and market trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We post all of our newsletters on our blog. If you want the full recap on what's been going on at Shovels, you can &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/?category=Company"&gt;read them all here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;One last thing about Shovels Online before it actually launches&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just want to say... this new software release is a big deal for us. I say this for a few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn't start Shovels to be a small company. Been there, done that. Shovels is meant to be a big company, and to be a big company, we need to have multiple interfaces. I firmly believe this. We're a data company at the core, but data isn't useful if you can't &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; to it, and not everybody wants an API key or a Snowflake table share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you (many, I hear) just want something to &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt;. That's it. Click, click, download. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're nice people and we want to help. So we're giving you that. (But not for free, silly. You still have to pay for it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our current software product leaves much to be desired but it gave us conviction that we should hire some professionals to make a truly great software product. That's what you can expect from the new Shovels Online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll see in a couple of weeks! You won't believe you ever logged into the old one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's where it gets interesting: I also believe that in the next year or so, a majority of our revenue will come from Shovels Online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're making decent money now, but most of it comes from the big data deals. We'll still do plenty of those, but I believe there's a huge demand for &lt;em&gt;click, click, download&lt;/em&gt; type of access to not only get the permit data but also the &lt;em&gt;insights&lt;/em&gt; we're packing into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not exist in the market today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get feedback from API and table share customers that we can percolate up to the software layer. That's the other benefit of having multiple interfaces: lots of customer feedback, coming from different perspectives. When we merge them together, magic happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By building software on our own data, we see our data and our API in a different way. It's easy to ignore the rough edges when we're not building anything on top of it. This "dogfooding" helps both of us and will continue to keep Shovels the best product for fast and easy permit intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that's why this is a big deal. New software gets released all the time (hello, &lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/"&gt;Product Hunt&lt;/a&gt;!) but these new products don't always define a market category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what we're trying to do here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll send another email out when the new and improved Shovels Online is LIVE! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;From the Engineering desk: backend fixes and contractor website domains!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first V2 API endpoints are live. Many of you have been asking for early access and we've been telling you we'll offer it -- we'll honor that, but not yet (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRgp2v9Km9M"&gt;not yet&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want it &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/NkEq3WBjWwHfaeHh8"&gt;fill out this form&lt;/a&gt; and tell us what you're working on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;🤓 Tech Stuff&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Infrastructure &amp;amp; Bug Fixes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New scripts, new data libraries, a bunch of little things add up to our best, smoothest, most amazing data run in the 14 months since we started doing this. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We also added some new monitoring features to the API so we debug any issues with greater speed and accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address Consolidation &amp;amp; Static IDs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We designed a new format for static address IDs that map across various geo scopes, such as individual addresses, cities, and counties, making it easier to reference and manage permits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This goes live at the end of the month! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;🔎 Contractor Website Domains&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been talking about this for months. SORRY. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting already, we're able to export custom reports with contractor domains appended!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've delivered a few reports to roaring applause, and I've used them myself to gather up more contractor contacts using Clay, but you can use any B2B database for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They key is to have the domain, which now you do. We'll push this out to the API once we get the other stuff shored up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can't wait to see what you all build with this! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: prospect into contractors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all things in modern go-to-market, it starts in &lt;a href="https://www.clay.com/"&gt;Clay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I've uploaded the Shovels output of a bunch of non-residential contractors. According to our permit data, these guys have worked on at least one commercial property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="1M domains on contractors" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/domains.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See that CONTRACTORS_WEBSITE field? That's new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we have the domains (huzzah!) we can easily use Prospeo's integration with Clay to look up emails from these domains. They'll return up to 50 emails at a time! All for about a nickel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, you just add the find email addresses enrichment and choose the CONTRACTORS_WEBSITE column. Clay makes this pretty intuititive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Use Shovels with Clay" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/clay.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now use Clay to further enhance with the name, title, and LinkedIn profile, or append other Shovels data for additional segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you watched our hackathon with Blueprint GTM, you saw how they used Clay, Shovels API, and Claude or ChatGPT to craft credible, unique messages to each contact. It was super fun to watch and it shows how creative sales and marketing folks can turn our data into prospecting gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're grateful and excited to be on this journey with you. We're only getting started!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category></entry><entry><title>Understanding Permit Data Fields</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/understanding-permit-data-fields/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-10-09T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2024-10-09T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alex Brown</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-10-09:/blog/understanding-permit-data-fields/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Shovels permit database has many fields, which are sometimes blank. Use the Data Dictionary to understand what these fields mean, and why some might be null. Review the most important fields for a permit, and filter out what isn't needed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Permits are incredibly data-dense objects, assuming that they’re filled out correctly and completely. It’s no simple task to keep all the fields straight, and if you have, contact us because we probably want to hire you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, I’ll walk through the vast world of Shovels permit (and other object) data fields, what they mean, why some fields are blank or &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, and some tips and tricks for cutting right to the critical fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using the Shovels Data Dictionary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With as many fields available across so many different data types (&lt;strong&gt;Permits&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Contractors&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Properties&lt;/strong&gt;, and more…), it’s a monumental task to keep track of which ones are where, and what they even mean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qiIxx37_-6vGfGp2i5pXv4w2FdsLsShjCqSVO5v6OMQ/edit?gid=1818227349#gid=1818227349"&gt;Data Dictionary&lt;/a&gt; comes in. This publicly-available spreadsheet (check the multiple tabs across the bottom for more info) gives an exhaustive breakdown of all the fields, variables, and parameters that our dataset contains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this tutorial, I’ll include a sample permit payload for a single permit from Agawam, MA. This includes all available fields for permits, beyond just the ones included in the Shovels &lt;strong&gt;Web App&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;API&lt;/strong&gt;. For definitions of any of these, check out the Data Dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear with me please, there are a lot of fields…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there’s a lot of detail here. Many of these are the key details that most of our insights are based on, yet still there are a ton of blank fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s dig in to these unfilled fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Are These Fields Blank?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some context, the permit fields we maintain in our database are unlikely to map 1:1 to any given permit if you actually looked at the source permit filing. However, as part of our aggregation methods, we have to combine and cover for all the possible fields that different jurisdictions may offer on their permits. This leads to a lot of empty fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance the number of empty fields in the sample above might be worrying. But if we take a look at the actual fields themselves, we’ll see that they’re pretty niche details to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are generally separated into four groups of field “classes”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optional professional contact details, like &lt;code&gt;applicant_name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;architect_phone&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;engineer_zipcode&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;designer_license&lt;/code&gt; — these are rarely used in general, but are exceedingly rare within the same permit. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Project-specific fields like &lt;code&gt;remodel_materials_used&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;reroof_type&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;num_windows&lt;/code&gt; — these may be used in a large scale project like an house-wide remodel, but for smaller projects they’ll usually be unrelated and left blank. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commonly unfilled fields like &lt;code&gt;job_value&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;fees&lt;/code&gt;, which are infrequently required and even less often accurate. This is especially true for non-contractor permits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derivative metrics when we’ve calculated and added to the payload, like &lt;code&gt;construction_duration&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;approval_duration&lt;/code&gt; , or &lt;code&gt;inspection_pass_rate&lt;/code&gt;  — these are based on other metrics, which are either left off historical records or are incomplete in the permit itself. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the variation in jurisdiction requirements for which fields are required, or even included, on their permits, it can be difficult for a single database schema to show only the relevant fields for a given permit. It’s definitely something we’re keeping in mind, but for the moment we trust that you’ll understand that not all fields are equally important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top 10 Most Useful Permit Fields&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 100 (!) different fields on a given permit flat file, but let’s highlight the most important ones. If any of these fields are empty, then &lt;a href="mailto:support@shovels.ai"&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;File_date&lt;/code&gt; : The date when the permit is filed with the permit department or jurisdiction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Permit_number&lt;/code&gt;: The local jurisdiction’s record identifier. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Owner_name&lt;/code&gt;: The name of the property owner for the permit work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Residential&lt;/code&gt;: Whether the permit is done to a commercial or residential property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Jurisdiction&lt;/code&gt;: The local governmental body which oversees the permit work. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt;: The type of permit work being done. These types are not standardized at the jurisdiction level, but at Shovels we’ve used LLMs to condense 600k+ variations into 22 project classifications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Subtype&lt;/code&gt;: The subtype of permit work being done, imported as a string directly from the permit source. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Status&lt;/code&gt;: The status of the permit, one of either &lt;code&gt;in_review&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;active&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;final&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;inactive&lt;/code&gt;. See our &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/shovels-101-permit-statuses/"&gt;blog post on permit statuses&lt;/a&gt; for more info. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Description&lt;/code&gt;: The description on the permit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Street&lt;/code&gt; (plus &lt;code&gt;street_no&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;zipcode&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;city&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; ): These fields collectively represent the permit’s address. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list above is generalized as a rule, so it’s very likely that the most important fields to your business are slightly different. But that’s ok, because our data is easy to filter to get exacly what you need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Customize the Data to Your Needs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have three different delivery methods, which are suited for different business needs. If you want simple data that can be accessed codelessly, then the &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/permit-database"&gt;Web App&lt;/a&gt; will be perfect for you. If you want a bit more, which can be programmatically integrated with your platform or product offering, then our &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/api"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; would be better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you really want to get granular, then our enterprise-ready &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/data-feed"&gt;Data Feed&lt;/a&gt; will be best. You can either access the entire Shovels dataset in your warehouse of choice, or you can get the raw data in flat file and query it yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter the use case, Shovels can get you what you need. Check out our &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;Free Trial&lt;/a&gt;, or get in touch with &lt;a href="mailto:sales@shovels.ai"&gt;Sales&lt;/a&gt; for data sample and demo call. &lt;/p&gt;

This provides new opportunities for unique insights. This new data needs an upgraded API, which will release soon.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Fall is here. For those of us with actual seasons (cough cough), we only need to look outside 🍁. For Californians, just as everyone else that relies on agriculture, a good harvest is absolutely essential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at Shovels, we have done a ton of work sharpening our plows, oiling our machinery, and sowing the seeds of a data harvest which will keep us fed through the winter. If you’re curious about some of that prep work, read how we &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/unlocking-shovelss-potential-with-prolific/"&gt;partnered with Prolific&lt;/a&gt; to supercharge our LLM-training. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the risk of over-extending this farming metaphor, the key to a good harvest is crop diversity. And at Shovels, we do not rely on a single data source to deliver our insights. Permit data from local jurisdictions will always be our bread and butter, but that alone is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hybridization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as cross-breeding species of plants can make them hardier for a given climate, or make them more insect- or blight-resistant, hybridized data is combined in such a way that it might not exist anywhere else. With AI-cleaning, clever columns, and SQL wizardry, we can join previously disjointed data into a new, multi-dimensional data models. Unique data is hard to come by, but the rewards far outweigh the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does that mean? It means that building permit data can be cross-referenced against property and tax assessor data. That contractor history and performance can be upgraded into distinct profiles with contact info and company websites. It means that everything in the Shovels dataset can be paired with residential demographics, which is a (the?) golden goose for behavior models and trend analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybridization improves a product by keeping the best pieces of it’s individual components. Use cases vary, and needs may evolve. Imagine if you were stuck with a single SQL join for an entire season, like the farmers with their new crop hybrids? Luckily, our platform provides  a national market-sized sandbox to play in. Evaluate and recombine the context-rich data to your heart’s content to see what new insights you can glean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enrichment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with a perfect harvest, where quality is unmatched and efficiency is optimized, more can always be added to improve the final product. Try baking something without eggs, dairy, or sugar, and let us know how it goes (and tastes — sorry vegans!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data and dough are similar in this regard, in that they benefit enormously from enrichment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Shovels, a key process for hybridizing our data is simple enrichment: take the messy and half-filled data we’re given by the local jurisdictions, and fill in the gaps ourselves. Someone really needs to pass a grant for additional federal funding to increase permit metadata requirements, it’d make our lives so much easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, simple enrichment is anything but. Simple means focused, in scope. It’s easy to get carried away, especially with enrichment vendors promising everything from phone numbers to timestamped Alexa commands. We make sure that our enrichment is ethical (ie, publicly-available) and relevant (filling a gap). To that end, we’re nearly ready to reap the unique data we’ve sown. When it’s here, you’ll be the first to know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future Harvests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of, we wanted to share a little sneak-peak at some things coming up soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this new data means new API endpoints. We’re releasing &lt;strong&gt;V2.0&lt;/strong&gt; of our API, plus a brand new web app, &lt;strong&gt;Shovels Online&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; week(!!) on October 24th. If you’ve been using the beta thus far, thank you for your patience — this new version is so much better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you happen to be in the Bay Area, we’re having a launch party that very evening: &lt;a href="mailto:sales@shovels.ai"&gt;reach out to us&lt;/a&gt; directly and we’ll add you to the guest list.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire Shovels team is hard at work preparing for the release of both products, and we can’t wait to share it with you. There will be plenty of fanfare, including an in-depth blog post outlining the key improvements of API v2.0, plus some other marketing material for the new Shovels Online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dinner Is Served, Dig In!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you use a spoon or a shovel, we’ve got all the intel you can eat (or analyze). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need verified and activity-based lead generation, we’ve got you covered. If you want to do some enrichment of your own by directly integrating your product with our data, our API will serve you well. If you need years of localized or nationwide property and construction data to feed your models, just tell us your preferred delivery method and we’ll pipe it over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get &lt;a href="mailto:sales@shovels.ai"&gt;in touch with us&lt;/a&gt; directly to be the first to access the new &lt;strong&gt;Shovels Online&lt;/strong&gt; and fine-tune a custom plan that matches your needs and budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you that have been on this journey with us for a while, we can’t thank you enough (last call for the launch party!). For those that recently joined (welcome!), you got here just in time 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

It has increased functionality, improved UX, and brand new features. It releases October 24th for general availability.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to Shovels V2&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launch week continues today with an introduction to the functionality of our V2, including both the Shovels &lt;strong&gt;API V2.0&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Shovels Online&lt;/strong&gt; (our new-and-improved web app). We've been hard at work for the past 6 months upgrading our infrastructure, increasing data fidelity and accuracy, and designing new endpoints and exploration opportunities via Shovels Online. Let's dig in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a bit of backstory. There are three levels to the Shovels platform - raw data feed, API, and web application - and each one has it's own strengths and weaknesses. To start, the raw data was the highest priority, as it was the foundation of all the layers on top of it. As engineering resources freed up and joined the team, we were able to dedicate more time to higher layers of the API and web app. The web app, as the shallowest layer, was both easier and more difficult to develop. Exploration was the key functionality, with integrated GIS functionality to search for permits via map view, as well as other filters and profiling which makes the permit data search a little more user-friendly for non-developer types. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the time for (near) parity has arrived, so we're breaking out all the new bells and whistles we've been cooking up to bring the API and Shovels Online versions up to speed with the data from the raw feed. We're not done though, not by a long shot. We have lofty aspirations for the Shovels platform, and 2.0 is just the next step. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Upgrades from V1.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk specifically about the API now. V1.0 had a few key objects, namely &lt;code&gt;address&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;contractor&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;permit&lt;/code&gt;. These all had interconnected metadata and parameters, some of which are obvious like &lt;code&gt;zip_code&lt;/code&gt;, where others are more nuanced like &lt;code&gt;contractors/name&lt;/code&gt; which required some cleaning on our end prior to delivery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In V2.0, we've done a huge overhaul to the former &lt;code&gt;address&lt;/code&gt; part, turning into the bright and shiny &lt;code&gt;geo_id&lt;/code&gt;. Instead of complicated concatenations of &lt;code&gt;street&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;house_number&lt;/code&gt; + &lt;code&gt;city&lt;/code&gt;, etc that made up an individual &lt;code&gt;address&lt;/code&gt; objects, now we have distinct ids assigned to every parcel, every zip code, every jurisdiction, every city, and every county. This makes our infrastructure way cleaner, faster, and simpler to connect our data to the literal earth underfoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the &lt;code&gt;geo_id&lt;/code&gt; refactoring, we've more than quintupled the search and filtering parameters for our endpoints. Now, you can specify things like &lt;code&gt;min_lot_size&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;c_min_total_permits_count&lt;/code&gt;, which can help you (or your sales teams) narrow your results to properties of a minimum size, or contractors with a minimum number of permits under their belt. This is just two such parameters, there are many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, with our brand new &lt;code&gt;geo_id&lt;/code&gt; schema, we can expand our search capabilities to a broader capacity, now including &lt;code&gt;counties&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;jurisdictions&lt;/code&gt;. While this change is helpful (and many of you specifically asked for it), the real kicker with these is how it further unlocks the capabilities of our web application, &lt;strong&gt;Shovels Online&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shovels Online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Marketing image of the new Shovels Online web application" src="/images/shovels-online.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our web application is built on top of our API, so most of the new features and upgrades have been inherited up a layer to enhance our live exploration and codeless offering. Here are a few of the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actual Onboarding&lt;/strong&gt;: First-time users will now be greeted with an actual onboarding wizard to help you establish your preferences and the type(s) of data you're looking for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Filtering&lt;/strong&gt;: New API endpoints (as described above) means better filtering options in the web app. Now available, you can search and refine by geographies, financial filters, building specs, permit details, and contractor profiles. And once you're there, you'll see a normal header of your selected filters, to make it easy to adjust as you need. And best of all, you can save your configured filters for repeat usage! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Results Downloads&lt;/strong&gt;: Now that we've implemented proper pagination, it's easier for us to configure a key feature that's been requested from the very beginning: downloading the results of a filter or search. For this initial release, we're maxing out downloads for a given search at 1000, but you can multi-select or unselect the ones you don't want prior to download. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detailed Drill-Downs&lt;/strong&gt;: The drill-down data has been one of the unique features specific to our web app, and so it's deserved special attention too. Now, when looking into a permit's details, we've put all the data we have at your fingertips. Sometimes they'll be rendered graphically, like permit status progress bars and historical timelines, sometimes they'll be hyperlinks to further details at all the geographical levels described in the &lt;code&gt;geo_id&lt;/code&gt; section above. We've interconnected the data as never before, and now you're free to explore that to your heart's content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saved Profiles&lt;/strong&gt;: This one is my personal favorite addition - being able to save the filters and results from a previous session for repeated use. If there are a few specific properties or contractors you're paying attention to, you can essentially bookmark them. If there's a detailed search query that you spent hours perfecting the parameters and filters on that you'll need to re-use every month, then you can just save it and it'll be there, waiting for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elegant UI&lt;/strong&gt;: Technical improvements aside, we've come along way to bring our UX/UI up to spec. We're users of our own platform every day, so we gave it the care and attention necessary to make it as smooth of an experience as possible. It's intuitive, interactive, and hopefully quicker to learn. The &lt;strong&gt;Shovels Online&lt;/strong&gt; platform is always improving, so please do not hesitate to let us know if we miss the mark or omitted something obvious and glaring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is extremely proud of the new web app, and we are hoping to unlock your exploratory potential to see US permit data in a brand new way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can promise that the moment V2.0 launches, we'll already be thinking towards to V2.1 and even V3.0. In fact, the entire Shovels team is meeting in person for our semi-annual summit this week for the launch to brainstorm, among other things, what we do next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the shorter term, we're completely open for feedback. We did our best, but it's impossible to plan for every use case, and we're constantly surprised at how clever your search queries and leverage strategies are. They go way beyond anything we thought of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please check out the new &lt;strong&gt;Shovels Online&lt;/strong&gt; when it launches &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; Thursday, Oct 24th. Walk through the system, double check the use cases you had in mind, and &lt;a href="mailto:support@shovels.ai"&gt;report back to us&lt;/a&gt; how it goes. We've got a big roadmap, but we're happy to add more items to make it that much smoother for you and your team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;That's all (for today)!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launch week continues, and we'll be releasing more info - sneak peaks at the UI, what will happen to existing web app customers, and more - very soon. Thank you for your continued support and hype, it means the world to us. &lt;/p&gt;

There are updates to functionality and UI/UX. Shovels Online's app and free trial are live today.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;Shovels Online&lt;/a&gt; (formerly our Web App beta) is the new best way for codeless and scriptless exploration of nationwide permit and contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve made a ton of functional upgrades (powered by our &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/welcome-to-shovels-v2/"&gt;Shovels API V2.0&lt;/a&gt;) which add 10x more filtering parameters, which will improve your search times and accuracy. There are also brand new UX elements in &lt;code&gt;Saved Profiles&lt;/code&gt;  and &lt;code&gt;Saved Filters&lt;/code&gt;  which let you save your work and jump back into your exploration or lead generation without a hitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And best of all, we’ve done a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; makeover. The UI is nearly unrecognizable, in the best way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s our sincere hope that this improvement will make everyone’s life easier, and we can’t wait for you to test it out. If you’re reading this, it’s &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;live right now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Powered by V2.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, the new-and-improved Shovels Online is running our API V2.0. What that means is that we’ve exposed a lot more data points in the raw permit, contractor, and property data from our back end. For the front end, that translates to better filtering options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old Contractor search was a bit of a one-way mirror. Search for a permit (or permits with certain characteristics like &lt;code&gt;Building Type&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Minimum Job Value&lt;/code&gt;), and you can find the Contractor that worked on it. The only way to find the Contractor directly required their &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;License Number&lt;/code&gt;, which didn’t really help that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mirror is broken and replaced with a window, allowing for arriving at your desired data from either direction. Find the contractor that works on the type of property, or find the type of contractor by the projects they’ve done. Dealer’s choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot of the Shovels Online web application's Map View" src="/images/shovels-online-map-view.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other major upgrade is the complete overhaul of our geo-spatial identifiers. With the introduction of the &lt;code&gt;geo_id&lt;/code&gt;, we have given every county, city, jurisdiction, address, and parcel in the US a unique ID. Permits are now mapped against the relevant &lt;code&gt;geo_id&lt;/code&gt;s all the way up the stack, and so the corresponding Contractors inherit that searchability too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been eager to make connecting the contractor-dots easier in Shovels Online, and have listened to when our customers (you!) asked. We’re happy to have pulled it off, and can’t wait to see what crazy lead gen shenanigans you figure out that we could not have dreamed of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Picking Up Where You Left Off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feature improvements are only as good as the underlying UX, so we’ve put a ton of man- and woman-hours into bringing this up to a new standard in Shovels Online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the twin streams of internal awareness and customer feedback led us time and again to the usability of the platform, and how annoying it was to spend an hour or two fine-tuning a set of parameters only to repeat the process the next month or quarter (or really whenever your sales team needed more leads). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you found a really good lead, but something was going weird with the “Download” button (yeah, sorry about that. It’s not as hack-y this time!). If you didn’t write it down, it might be tough to remember the exact details of the permit, property, or contractor you had in your sights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you can save your progress in either a &lt;code&gt;Saved Profile&lt;/code&gt;  or &lt;code&gt;Saved Filter&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot of the Shovels Online web application's Saved Profile page" src="/images/shovels-online-saved-profiles.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Saved Profile&lt;/code&gt; is all about keeping track of the individual search results you find, whether they’re Permits, Addresses, Contractors, or even Counties and Jurisdictions. Click the bookmark icon in the top left, and come back to it another day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Saved Filter&lt;/code&gt; is even better, since it will reduce lead generation time significantly. Fine-tune your parameters once, then apply the filter. If it looks right, click the “heart” icon by the top left, and name it something helpful. Do this as many times as you need for each segment, and then the repeat work next month will be that much easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel up to it, let us know how much actual time it saves. We’re building up a &lt;strong&gt;Customer Spotlight&lt;/strong&gt; program, and would love to highlight (to our own engineers, most of all) the real-world benefits that their new efforts bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UI Makeover&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of the UI, let’s get into the details. The old web app, formerly found at &lt;code&gt;beta.shovels.ai&lt;/code&gt;, was always a test run. It was bare-bones, only delivered on a fraction of the data we had in our back end, and sometimes didn’t work as you expected. Outside of that, the UI left much to be desired. It’s a new age, and we weren’t going to accept a mediocre-to-bad web application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started with cleaning it up. Modernizing fonts and icons, better use of existing color schemes, and the like. Leaving Shovels Online and looking back at the beta web app, it’s hard to believe that we used that for so long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once it was clean(er), we moved on to function. Quick actions to support the new functionality and filtering capabilities we discussed earlier. Entire new pages dedicated to dashboarding your saved work, plus an overarching search capability that extended beyond raw address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot more pure form and function that’s improved - from an actual onboarding process to nicer maps to better account management - but we’re now looking for help building the next iteration. Get in there, break what you can, discover what function we missed, and let us know so we can fix it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Live Now!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shovels Online&lt;/strong&gt; has been a work of love (and sweat and tears), and we’re so proud of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were using our previous version (at &lt;code&gt;beta.shovels.ai&lt;/code&gt;), then your account will be automatically ported over. If you’ve been waiting for the V2 launch to test out the new Shovels Online version, now is your time! Create a &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;Free Trial&lt;/a&gt; account today, and get digging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as always, &lt;a href="mailto:support@shovels.ai"&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt; if there are any questions or issues.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="product launch"></category><category term="web application"></category></entry><entry><title>Shovels Spotlight: Deep Product Enrichment with Inspectify</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/shovels-spotlight-deep-product-enrichment-with-inspectify/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-11-13T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2024-11-13T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Alex Brown</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-11-13:/blog/shovels-spotlight-deep-product-enrichment-with-inspectify/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shovels highlights companies that use their product well.

&lt;p&gt;That’s where Shovels comes in — Inspectify integrated with our API to bring in property permit history and complete the home inspection picture. Shovel’s API is easy to use, making it easy for the Inspectify engineering team to enrich their inspection reports with the permit data that sets their inspection reports above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inspectify and Permit Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Inspectify team always had their eye on permit data, but struggled to find the right source or integration fit. That is, until they met Shovels. The insights that can be gleaned from the Shovels dataset — things like permit or connected contractor history — is crucial for the wholesale assessment that’s central to the Inspectify report workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"We started Shovels because there wasn’t a clear and easy way to programmatically access building permit data. There wasn’t an easy to use, well-documented, nationwide building permit API. So we set out to build it, and we’re very happy to have partners like Inspectify use our API to put our permit data to work." - Ryan, CEO &amp;amp; Co-Founder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only do these extra data points set them apart from other home inspection platforms, but it gives them a material leg up on leveraging their holistic insights across the board. They look great on the inspection reports themselves, but are also key for lending institutions and risk assessment brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to have the full picture, and Shovels’s seamless API integration allows Inspectify to do just that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Shovels Integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels has a simple yet powerful &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/api"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;, which gave the Inspectify Product and Engineering teams an easy way to design their product around our data offering. Between the API docs themselves, the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qiIxx37_-6vGfGp2i5pXv4w2FdsLsShjCqSVO5v6OMQ/edit?gid=1818227349#gid=1818227349"&gt;Data Dictionary&lt;/a&gt; for additional clarity, and live support sessions from the Shovels team, Inspectify was able to easily connect the Shovels data to their existing home inspection report generation pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A Screenshot of the Inspectify product, highlighting the section that directly integrates the Shovels permit data." src="/images/inspectify-spotlight-report-summary.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the Inspectify report itself, Shovels provides the data for their handy “Summary” section, which aggregates and counts available permits for this address, some general classification of the types of projects being done, with the option to drill down into the direct permits themselves. This drill down shows a granular view into the individual permits themselves, including the contractor business name if available. All of these are pulled as individual colors within the wider picture being painted for an individual address. And if we say so ourselves, really tie it all together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"I want to thank [the Shovels team] for the communication, flexibility, and back and forth. We have a lot of projects and the ability to get quick answers from you has really helped us develop this integration." - Alex Mathieu, VP of Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hallmark of the collaboration between Shovels and Inspectify on this product integration was the high quality of communication between the teams. Their Product team worked with us over multiple calls to ensure that their designs made sense with the Shovels data structures. Once the design was done, Engineering had some requests too: we added some functionality to our existing endpoints to better handle the bulk requests that made more sense for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Spotlights-R-Us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every project needs a shovel and a spotlight (well, at least a work lamp).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At our core, we’re data people. We love to see cool projects doing even cooler things with publicly available data, especially in the real-estate and construction space. It makes our sweat and tears thus far spent making this data “shovel-ready” completely worth it. When that happens, we want to shine a spotlight on the great work and collaboration between Shovels and Inspectify: something less than a full-blown case study, but more than a shout out on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These kinds of collaborations are happening with most of our customers, so expect more of this content monthly. Hopefully you’ll find either a &lt;a href="https://www.inspectify.com/"&gt;cool new proptech company&lt;/a&gt; to check out, or get inspiration for how your own product might &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/api"&gt;integrate&lt;/a&gt; with the Shovels dataset. If you’re the latter, then check out our API in a &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;Free Trial&lt;/a&gt;, or contact &lt;a href="mailto:sales@shovels.ai"&gt;Sales&lt;/a&gt; to get a data sample and platform demo.&lt;/p&gt;

Subscribe today before prices increase.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We just &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/welcome-to-shovels-online/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the release of our new-and-improved web application, &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;Shovels Online&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s time to dig deeper into some best practices, tips and tricks, and other insider guidance from the Shovels team to help you leverage our platform to it’s fullest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: We’re still technically in early-adopter territory, as far as pricing goes. If you’ve been considering our platform thus far, now’s the best time to get in on the action before prices go up! Black Friday is coming a little early this year 🎁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shovels Online Use Cases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with our other products, like our &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/api"&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/data-feed"&gt;Enterprise data&lt;/a&gt; offering, Shovels Online has the lowest barrier to entry. But just because it’s web-based and codeless doesn’t mean it isn’t powerful in it’s own right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any tool, it’s important to know which one to use. Shovels are designed to dig, and Shovels Online is designed to explore opportunities. Let’s get in to a few of our most common use cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Homeowner Leads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;f you’re a New England regional heat pump retailer (or installer!), then you can use the Shovels Online permit database to find addresses with homeowner contact details in your market that show signals of buyer intent and interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those signals might be recently pulled permits for other green or climate-friendly appliances, like solar panels or other electrification projects. This shows that they’re already interested in upgrading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross-referencing those results against a list of addresses that recently pulled permits for fossil fuel-based heater installs lets you narrow down your search to those who may have aging heating systems, in need of replacement. Now you’re confident that you wont waste your time selling a heat pump to someone that just replaced their gas heater last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now have a lead list complete with contact details and permit contexts, and all that’s left is for your Sales team to start reaching out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It truly is that simple. Replace “heat pump” with “bathroom remodel”, “roof”, or whatever business you’re in, and the rest of the logic will stay the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Contractor Leads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using nearly identical logic to the homeowner section above, you - a completely different New England regional heat pump &lt;em&gt;supplier&lt;/em&gt; - may instead want to search for contractors in your market area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on your model, you may want to go after the experienced and proven contractors and offer them a better deal than their existing supplier. Alternatively, you may want to look for brand new contractors, fresh-faced and newly entering the market, and build a relationship with them from the very beginning. The world is your oyster (stew). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;code&gt;Building&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Permit&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Contractor&lt;/code&gt; filters, you can fine-tune your search to the exact specifications of your business model, and export all that data (including contact info) into a CSV and the waiting arms of your outbound Sales team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Derivative Lead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeowner and Contractor leads are by far the most common, but we’ve been routinely surprised by the breadth and width of opportunities that you can glean from public permit data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permit approval timing: Use Shovels Online to figure out how long it will take to get that heat pump permit in your target jurisdiction!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resident demographics: We just released a new API endpoint for identifying residents of addresses. Now you know who to make that postcard out to 😊&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to Build a High-Quality Search&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve got the general use cases covered, let’s dig deep into the logic of a Shovels Online search query, how to leverage the entire range of filters, and make sure that the results are actually what you’re looking for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Specific Geographies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to determine what scale are you looking at, and in what region. If it’s a pretty niche project type, like New England &lt;code&gt;pool&lt;/code&gt; installations, then you may want to zoom out and look at the &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, if you’re looking at something very common like &lt;code&gt;New Construction&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Residential&lt;/code&gt;, then you may want to get as granular as &lt;code&gt;zip code&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, you have unlimited searches, so there’s no harm in going piecemeal and working through your market area and seeing what volume you’re getting back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Permits or Contractors?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Permits and Contractors are the two main axes by which all Shovels data is aligned, and Shovels Online is no different. While there is some overlap, like wanting to know the connected contractor on a given permit, most people will want to search for one or the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, we suggest looking at which persona you’re trying to sell to (a homeowner or a contractor) and choose accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Focusing on Key Filters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most important and powerful upgrades to our web application with the release of Shovels Online is the increased number of filters and parameters. You can now specify minimum project details for a given structure across multiple dimensions. Things like &lt;code&gt;minimum market value&lt;/code&gt; , &lt;code&gt;minimum lot size&lt;/code&gt;, or even keywords from the permit &lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt; make it easier than ever to get the exact kind of projects that fit your business model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Contractor side, you can filter by performance metrics too: &lt;code&gt;minimum total permits&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;maximum [project] duration&lt;/code&gt; and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Spot-Check the Results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve built out the perfect query, it’s time to put the results to the test. Once the filters are applied and the results are in, spot check a few by clicking “View Details” and make sure that it matches your expectation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the volume you need, you may need to expand or contract your geography or &lt;code&gt;date range&lt;/code&gt;. Adjust those, or any other filters, as needed and re-apply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, once you’re happy with what you’ve found, there’s two final steps: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the filters, so you can repeat this search query later. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the list, so you can run whatever final filters on the CSV file before dividing it up amongst your Sales team. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using all these steps, you’ll set yourself up for the greatest chance of success in curating and delivering a high quality lead list. If you run into any errors, or have other questions about the results you see, don’t hesitate to &lt;a href="mailto:support@shovels.ai"&gt;reach out to us&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips and Tricks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general tutorial above should get most people 95% of the way there. However, there are a few nifty tricks and optimizations that may be useful to you. As the Shovels Online platform grows and matures, and our engineers get to deliver on the functionality they’ve been dreaming up, expect this “Tips and Tricks” list to only grow from here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Smart Exporting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, the “Download List” button caps out at 1000 rows in CSV file. If you want to get more than 1000, then you can slightly adjust the filters (such as geography) to get a new set of 1000 rows. With some quick combination and deduplication, you can easily build a Frankenstein lead list of as many rows as you can find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will note that this &lt;strong&gt;is not&lt;/strong&gt; suggested at scale. If you’re finding yourself working at such volumes, we highly suggest checkout our our API, which is purpose-built for those kinds of loads. Plus, there are even more filters for even better search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Saving Your Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Shovels Online we introduced the Saved Profiles feature, which allows you to favorite and save individual permits, contractors, or geographies for easy and convenient future access. Beyond that, you can also save the exact filters and search parameters you’ve been working on already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So once you’ve fine tuned your super query that fits the exact model and needs of your team, never fear of needing to recreate it later. It’ll be there, under &lt;code&gt;Saved Filters&lt;/code&gt;, for next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get In Now!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned at the top, this is an exciting time to be using &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;Shovels Online&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to lock-in our old pricing then be sure to &lt;a href="mailto:sales@shovels.ai"&gt;reach out to our Sales team&lt;/a&gt; for help getting your account set up and your discount confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you’re new here (welcome!) and interested in our platform, then we’d love to chat more about your specific use case and learn what permit data means to you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that this tutorial is helpful, and Happy Digging!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Customer Success"></category><category term="web application"></category><category term="tutorial"></category></entry><entry><title>December 2024 Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/december-2024-newsletter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-12-19T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2024-12-19T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2024-12-19:/blog/december-2024-newsletter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We added some new tools to the Shovels web app. We also now have a nationwide contractor directory, so anybody can look up contractors based on their service area, not just their work address. And we're doing a lot of data enrichment!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t it feel like I haven’t written one of these in a while? Maybe it’s just me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, boy oh boy… do WE have some THINGS to REPORT this month. More below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We launched! That thing we flooded your inbox about last month? It’s live and it works and we have the subscription invoices to prove it. This newsletter will probably mostly be about Shovels Online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We now have millions of home residents, contractor employees, and website domains. They’re all in the API and database files. Soon they’ll be in Shovels Online too. Who cares? YOU DO! I’ll tell you why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coming up next month: modeled job values for more accurate contractor revenue segmentation. Super excited about this one!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10M new permits. A dozen new jurisdictions. A half-dozen new API endpoints. Overhaul of our &lt;a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions/sub_1QWfsBF4y5bBweC6N8xBg1c7"&gt;Coverage Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;. New jurisdiction profile pages in the web app...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yeesh, we’re ready for winter break!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Quick reminder&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're getting this email because you reached out to us. We send one big newsletter each month. People seem to like it -- we now have over 3,800 subscribers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels transforms building permit data into actionable insights about contractors, homeowners, and market trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We post all of our newsletters on our blog. If you want the full recap on what's been going on at Shovels, you can &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/?category=Company"&gt;read them all here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A better Shovels Online&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Summerhill contractor profile" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/summerhill.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been writing about this for a while. Now we have something to &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; show you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty to improve but we can see what this little toddler will grow up to be and we’re awfully proud. The bones are good. We’re on our way to building a truly remarkable data exploration tool for the construction industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few features that I personally love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download 1,000 records exceptionally fast&lt;/strong&gt;. This is not like the old app. You get 1,000 custom-filtered contractor or permit records in CSV format at lightning speed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combine building and permit attributes in your searches&lt;/strong&gt;. Find &lt;em&gt;solar&lt;/em&gt; contractors who work on &lt;em&gt;commercial&lt;/em&gt; buildings. Find &lt;em&gt;roofing&lt;/em&gt; guys that specialize in the &lt;em&gt;residential&lt;/em&gt; market. In any zip, any county, any city. Then download!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See contractor permit volume over time&lt;/strong&gt;. This is new! We now have helpful charts on contractor profiles that show how permit volumes change over time. Group by month, quarter, or year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jurisdiction profiles&lt;/strong&gt;. This was one of the major reasons for V2. We needed to refactor our API structure and how we filter by geographies and that led to this idea: profiles for every geography. Every city, every county, every address, every permit jurisdiction. You can see the very start of this now by clicking the &lt;strong&gt;Search&lt;/strong&gt; menu in the top navigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: We’re restricting free trials to one week. If you want to extend or talk about pricing options, please reach out! We’re friendly and want to help. Best email for that is &lt;a href="mailto:sales@shovels.ai"&gt;sales@shovels.ai&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;An even better API&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/permits/search-permits"&gt;V2 API&lt;/a&gt; has been out for a minute. People like it. It’s way better than V1, which we put together before we really knew how people like to query building permits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I predict that the V2 will stand the test of time. It’s modular, it’s elegant, and it works the way prop, climate, and construction tech developers expect it to work. It’s already pretty great and it will continue to get better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That better-ment has already begun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contractor employees&lt;/strong&gt;. THIS IS A BIG ONE. Many, many, many of you have been asking to go deeper into the org. You don’t necessarily want the email or phone of the person who filed the permit. You want their procurement, finance, or marketing leader. Now you can get them in Shovels. This just launched &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/contractors/list-contractor-employees"&gt;in the API&lt;/a&gt; today. We’ll get this into the web app ASAP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contractor metrics.&lt;/strong&gt; We give you everything you need to count permits and sum revenue by month, quarter, or year for any contractor. Many of you asked for this! What’s the 2023 revenue for Joe’s Plumbing? We had to run SQL queries for you. Now you can do this self-serve with the API.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geography metrics&lt;/strong&gt;. Since we roll permits into contractors and compute metrics, we figured this should happen to geographies too. Now we offer the equivalent metrics endpoints for county, city, and jurisdiction. We figure this will be GREAT for market intelligence as you decide where to expand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Residents of addresses&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a cool one. When you get the geo_id of an address, you can look up who is associated with that address and get their email and phone. These emails and phone numbers are ad campaign-ready; they’re already associated with online identities that you can advertise against. There’s so much you can do with this!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contractor domains&lt;/strong&gt;. Finally, contractor domains. I’ve been spending a lot of time working in Clay and am already seeing the benefits of having contractor domains to associate with other datasets. This is a work-in-progress and we’ll continue to add more domains (coverage is ~50% today). It’s clear to me, though, how much productivity this can unlock. We’re excited to be in the GTM trenches with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: run ads&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m coming back to this use case because we just signed our first major online audience deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new customer is using permits to identify remodeling prospects in specific local geographies nationwide. They could maybe back into this audience using website visits, but it’s messy. Just because you googled how long a roof lasts doesn’t mean you’re looking to replace your roof tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you know if someone’s actually in the market &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;? You look at their permits. We ran a few tests for these guys and it worked really well. We could provide them with a bunch of relevant home improvement segments that they can go and sell to their customers. We have a few other major deals like this in the works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of homeowners that we can identify:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Likely to need a new roof&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Likely to make a major home purchase (refrigerators, stoves, couches) soon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Likely to want a new home appliance warranty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Likely in the market for a home maintenance subscription&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Likely in the market for pool supplies and maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these audiences can have hundreds of thousands of people, easily targeted online. Let us know if you want more details! &lt;/p&gt;

The API provides two primary resources: Permits (official construction documents from local authorities) and Contractors (skilled building trade professionals).&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Getting Started with the Shovels API: A How-To Guide&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai"&gt;Shovels API&lt;/a&gt; is your gateway to a wealth of construction industry data. Whether you're building property tech, climate solutions, or construction software, our API makes it easy to access detailed information about building permits and licensed contractors. Let's walk through how to get started and make the most of our powerful filtering capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview of the API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shovels API revolves around two main resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permits&lt;/strong&gt; - Official documents issued by cities or counties that track construction and building alterations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contractors&lt;/strong&gt; - Skilled professionals who perform the permitted work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus some handy additional resources:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lists&lt;/strong&gt; - Pre-defined values for filtering (like property types and work categories)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addresses&lt;/strong&gt; - Search and validate US addresses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta&lt;/strong&gt; - Information about the API and data coverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geography&lt;/strong&gt; - Find locations by searching cities, counties, and zip codes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quick Start: Authentication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting started is easy! All API requests need an API key in the &lt;code&gt;X-API-Key&lt;/code&gt; header. Here's how to get one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign up for a free account at &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai/create-account/"&gt;https://app.shovels.ai/create-account/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find your API key in your account dashboard (click your email in the top right)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a simple Python example to get you going:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;API_KEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;your_api_key_here&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;BASE_URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;https://api.shovels.ai/v2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BASE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/permits/search&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;permit_from&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;2022-01-01&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;permit_to&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;2023-12-31&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;geo_id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;TX&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;property_type&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;residential&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Filter by property type&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;permit_tags&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;solar&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;hvac&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Filter by work type&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;X-API-Key&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;API_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Power Filtering with Property Types and Tags&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most powerful features of our API is the ability to filter by property types and work categories (tags). This helps you zero in on exactly the data you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Property Type Filtering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;property_type&lt;/code&gt; parameter lets you focus on specific types of buildings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;residential&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commercial &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;industrial&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;agricultural&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vacant_land&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recreational&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exempt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;miscellaneous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, to find all commercial permits in Texas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;permit_from&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;2022-01-01&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;permit_to&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;2023-12-31&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;geo_id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;TX&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;property_type&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;commercial&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Work Category (Tags) Filtering&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;permit_tags&lt;/code&gt; parameter helps you find specific types of work. Some popular tags include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;solar - Solar panel installations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hvac - Heating and cooling work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;reroof - Roofing projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;room_addition - Home additions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;kitchen_remodel - Kitchen renovations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bath_remodel - Bathroom renovations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;new_dwelling - New home construction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pool_spa - Pool and spa installations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;utilities - Utility work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;window_door - Window and door replacements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find all residential solar projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;permit_from&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;2022-01-01&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;permit_to&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;2023-12-31&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;geo_id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;TX&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;property_type&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;residential&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;permit_tags&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;solar&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finding Permits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;/permits/search&lt;/code&gt; endpoint is your main tool for discovering permits. At minimum, you need:
- A date range (&lt;code&gt;permit_from&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;permit_to&lt;/code&gt;)
- A location (&lt;code&gt;geo_id&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;code&gt;geo_id&lt;/code&gt; can be a state ("TX"), zip code ("78701"), city, or county. For cities and counties, you'll need to look up their specific geo_id first using our geography endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BASE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/permits/search&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response includes a wealth of information about each permit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;items&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;caf3b9d5ce317d53&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;description&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Solar panel installation with battery backup&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;number&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;RE2303928&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;jurisdiction&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Austin&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;property_type&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;residential&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;tags&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;solar&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;utilities&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;page&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;size&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;quot;next_page&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finding Contractors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contractor search works similarly to permits. Use &lt;code&gt;/contractors/search&lt;/code&gt; with the same filtering capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;permit_from&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;2022-01-01&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;permit_to&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;2023-12-31&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;geo_id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;TX&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;property_type&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;residential&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;permit_tags&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;solar&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BASE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/contractors/search&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will find contractors who have done residential solar work in Texas during your date range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting More Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have a permit or contractor ID, you can get full details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Get permit details&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;permit_params&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;caf3b9d5ce317d53&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BASE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/permits&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;permit_params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Get contractor details&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;contractor_params&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;e79c3393ad&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;requests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BASE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;/contractors&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;contractor_params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Beyond the Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The API offers many more capabilities:
- Get contractor performance metrics

From team expansion to technological breakthroughs, we've hit some important milestones that will carry us through to 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revenue Growth&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We began 2024 with a few thousand in monthly recurring revenue and grew it more than 10X while our subscriber count tripled. Our average contract value increased three-fold in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We signed huge public companies and brand new startups. We work with teams of data scientists and single founders. I hope we’ll be able to continue serving a wide variety of customers: a unique feature of being a data business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Team Expansion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We doubled our team size in 2024, growing from three to six team members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Betty, Alex, and Whitney joined to strengthen our enterprise sales, SMB sales, and customer support capabilities. We’ll grow the product and engineering team in 2025, which has stayed remarkably small since Petra joined us in May 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Product Evolution &amp;amp; Technical Achievements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2024 was a big year for our product development. A major highlight was the dramatic improvement in our data processing capabilities: we reduced our monthly batch processing time from two weeks down to just a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re setting the stage for incorporating additional sources to keep enriching our dataset, and we want to make that as smooth and automated as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another big improvement was implementing AI-based permit categorization. We successfully developed the capability to process over 100 million prompts in record time and without breaking the bank. We’re going to do a lot more of this in 2025!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strategic Partnerships&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also established new partnerships with industry leaders including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Esri:&lt;/strong&gt; Leading provider of geospatial software used by retail, governments, and data center companies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autodesk &amp;amp; Procore:&lt;/strong&gt; Premier construction project management platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience Acuity &amp;amp; Datonics:&lt;/strong&gt; Our first foray into self-serve audiences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software Evolution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2024, we remained committed to improving our software platform, &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;Shovels Online&lt;/a&gt;. We launched multiple iterations of our web application, each bringing new improvements to the user experience. The culmination of these efforts was our &lt;code&gt;V2&lt;/code&gt; release, which includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More geographic identification attributes for improved location-based searching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parity between &lt;code&gt;contractor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;permit&lt;/code&gt; filter parameters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New &lt;code&gt;property&lt;/code&gt; filters separated from &lt;code&gt;permit&lt;/code&gt; filters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our web app runs on the API endpoints that we make available to our customers, it just has a lower barrier-to-entry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've created what we believe to be the best building permit and contractor API and software on the market today, and we’re far from done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking Forward to 2025&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The momentum we've built in 2024 sets the stage for more important work in 2025. We're focusing on several key initiatives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing to optimize our data processing and delivery systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expanding our partnership network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhancing our software platform with new contractor discovery features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More geographical profile pages, including addresses profiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're more excited than ever about our mission to make construction permit data more accessible and actionable. &lt;strong&gt;We're deeply grateful to all of you&lt;/strong&gt;: our customers, partners, and team members who made 2024 such a successful year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been the most fun we've ever had in business, and we're just getting started.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="2024"></category></entry><entry><title>January 2025 Newsletter</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/january-2025-newsletter/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-01-15T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2025-01-15T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Ryan Buckley</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2025-01-15:/blog/january-2025-newsletter/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Shovels.ai kicks off 2025 with a smooth January release adding 9 new jurisdictions, improved documentation, new profile pages, and employee data. Looking ahead, the company plans major enhancements to permit data coverage and contractor insights, including job value modeling, retail associations, and revenue metrics.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m told that it’s mid-January and time for a greeting transition. So — I hope your year is off to a great start! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what’s making our new year happy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;January release was super smooth. 9 new jurisdictions. 162M total permits!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I ❤️ me some good tech docs. Fortunately for us, our support extraordinaire Alex Brown has delivered. Check out his winter project: https://docs.shovels.ai&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The web app now has city, county, and jurisdiction profile pages (more on these below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reminder: we show employees on contractor profiles now, and you can download them!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My own winter project was a website rebuild. Happy new website: https://www.shovels.ai&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the API we have a new &lt;code&gt;first_seen_date&lt;/code&gt; contractor attribute so you can tell those freshman electricians about all the goods and services you offer. You’ll be able to filter for them soon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also coming soon: address profiles! They’ll be like Carfax, but for addresses, and included in your web app and API subscriptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All the above was staged by a stellar 2024. &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/2024-shovels-year-end-recap/"&gt;Read our 2024 recap in the blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're getting this email because you reached out to us. We send one big newsletter each month. People seem to like it -- we now have over 4,500 subscribers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels transforms building permit data into actionable insights about contractors, homeowners, and market trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We post all of our newsletters on our blog. If you want the full recap on what's been going on at Shovels, you can &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/?category=Company&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ahRe7B39PsnJ6dmdnVj6D6zmvBklI3407wxLC1yUPCPJRuRZuQlXhwFlDyP9nNZbXbu9D"&gt;read them all here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A look ahead at 2025&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll sum up 2025 in two words: &lt;strong&gt;permits&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;contractors&lt;/strong&gt;. Come to think of it, that’d sum up 2024, too. Hooray for consistency! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we’re look forward to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Permits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More job values&lt;/strong&gt;: we’re pretty far along on our permit job value model. The jurisdictions give us job value in only 25% of permits, so we’re modeling the other 75% with fancy statistics. By the end of this month we’ll have the nation’s most complete picture of construction costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More coverage&lt;/strong&gt;: we know there are gaps. We’re working with our partners to plug the holes, especially in the populated metro areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less latency&lt;/strong&gt;: we also want to give you new permits and status changes as soon as they happen. We can’t do that with monthly updates. It’s a tricky problem but we’ll find a way to solve it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retail associations&lt;/strong&gt;: We’re associating commercial permits with the names of the retail businesses that operate there. You’ll be able to look up all the Starbucks permits in San Francisco and who worked those jobs, for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jurisdiction lookup&lt;/strong&gt;: We now have a prototype that identifies the permit jurisdiction of ANY address in the US. Next, we’ll pre-compute the permit jurisdictions of all 155M addresses in our database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parcel associations&lt;/strong&gt;: We’ve been talking a lot with our friends at &lt;a href="https://regrid.com/"&gt;Regrid&lt;/a&gt; and are excited to finally start working on permit-parcel associations. We’ll roll permit summaries onto tens of millions of their parcels and make it very easy to run additional geospatial analyses in ArcGIS and other Esri products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Contractors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue metrics&lt;/strong&gt;: All those new job values roll up nicely onto our contractor profiles. When the job values are live, we’ll give you the most accurate estimates of contractor revenue by month, quarter, and year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More domains and employees&lt;/strong&gt;: When it comes to B2B GTM AI (that’s “business-to-business go-to-market artificial intelligence”), website domains are the elixir of life. All the B2B companies use website domains to connect their databases. We’ve associated about 500,000 contractors with domains and employees and we’ll keep working on the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metrics and badges&lt;/strong&gt;: Break down contractors by property type, property category, or revenue tiers. We’ll make badges for contractors to signify which contractors do building electrification, are very active, appear dormant, or are willing to travel far from their HQ.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to be the absolute very best at all of this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tech Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New Documentation Hub&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is a long time coming, but we've now released our centralized documentation hub. Check it out here at &lt;a href="http://docs.shovels.ai/"&gt;docs.shovels.ai&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll use this to host our &lt;strong&gt;API Reference&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Tutorials&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Troubleshooting Guides&lt;/strong&gt;,  &lt;strong&gt;Release Notes&lt;/strong&gt;, and much more to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Updated Shovels Online&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://app.shovels.ai/"&gt;Shovels Online&lt;/a&gt; will always be a work in progress, but we've made significant strides over the holidays to bring it closer to our end vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we've connected the various profiles across the entire platform, so you'll be able to navigate between cities, counties, and jurisdictions from either &lt;strong&gt;Contractor Profiles&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Permit Records&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, we've also included a new downloadable Employee table on &lt;strong&gt;Contractor Profiles&lt;/strong&gt;, so you can now dig deeper into the personnel at the individual companies you're researching. This is &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; helping our customers target their outreach more effectively!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;New &lt;code&gt;/employees&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/metrics&lt;/code&gt; API endpoints&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to our prior month's platform improvement of including detailed employee data into our contractors table, we're now bringing that to our API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/contractors/list-contractor-employees"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/v2/contractors/{id}/employees&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; endpoint will allow you to retrieve an array of listed employees, including a wide range of demographic information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/addresses/get-address-metrics"&gt;&lt;code&gt;/v2/addresses/{id}/metrics&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; endpoint will return a detailed monthly digest of construction data for a given address, which will include breakdowns of permit counts across various states, as well as associated contractors, plus extra derived metrics like &lt;code&gt;avg_construction_duration&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;avg_inspection_pass_rate&lt;/code&gt; to name a few. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things to do with permits: drop pins onto shapefiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shapefile is a GIS data format that stores geographic features like points, lines, and polygons along with their attributes. It’s used in popular softwares like Esri ArcGIS for cool geospatial analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We care about shapefiles because they define the boundaries of cities, counties and parcels. If we wanted to associate permits with cities or incorporated territories, we have to know whether the permit address actually sits inside the city boundary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is easier said than done! The process goes a bit like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get tens of millions of addresses from building permit databases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run them through an API like Google Maps (good-bye money 💸) or find a better way (like we did) to get the latitude and longitude of each address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now find a shapefile for every city, county, and parcel in the country (or ask a friend)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And THEN write a cool Python script to see if your permit coordinates land inside any of those shapefiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew 😮‍💨 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you can pull that off… nice! You can now associate your permits with a TON of other geo-databases from public and private sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or just sit tight and let us do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like we’re still in the first inning here and have a long game ahead of us, but we’re at the plate and swinging hard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy new year! 🫢&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category><category term="newsletter"></category></entry><entry><title>Welcome to the Shovels Documentation Hub</title><link href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/welcome-to-the-shovels-documentation-hub/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-01-16T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2025-01-24T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Alex Brown</name></author><id>tag:www.shovels.ai,2025-01-16:/blog/welcome-to-the-shovels-documentation-hub/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Breakdown of the new Shovels documentation hub. Includes a feature comparison against the blog, and describes the nature of the content in the docs hub.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Clean and modern documentation is the standard for developer-first products. The spectrum of provided information goes from a simple API Reference document, like the kind generated by an OpenAPI spec file, all the way to a sprawling knowledge base spanning multiple products, platforms, and languages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, Shovels was on the simpler end of the spectrum. Don’t get us wrong, this served us and our developer-minded customers very well, but we all knew it was time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with the release of &lt;a href="http://docs.shovels.ai" target="_blank"&gt;docs.shovels.ai&lt;/a&gt;, we’re moving closer and closer to the end of the story, and it will continue to grow in tandem with the rest of the Shovels platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Centralized Source for Technical Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers famously prefer to streamline and simplify the learning process as much as possible. They have a mission (understand and use a product) and want to do so as quickly as possible (avoiding lengthy product trial rounds, in-depth sales calls, etc). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A documentation hub is therefore the self-service, one-stop-shop technical resource for anyone, no matter their skill level or familiarity with the product. This has been the underlying methodology for designing our docs hub, and will continue to guide our development of quickstart guides, how-to tutorials, reference, and explanation content (shout out to the &lt;a href="https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/" target="_blank"&gt;Divio method&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do those technical resources look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://docs.shovels.ai" target="_blank"&gt;docs.shovels.ai&lt;/a&gt; stands on the three pillars of &lt;strong&gt;Documentation&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;API Reference&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Release Notes&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/docs/introduction" target="_blank"&gt;Documentation&lt;/a&gt; is the largest pillar, which will contain four main components. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quickstart Guides&lt;/strong&gt;: Introductory guides aimed at beginners just starting with the platform. Eventually, we’ll have some in place for each of our three product offerings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tutorials&lt;/strong&gt;: These are step-by-step walkthroughs of specific actions you can do within the Shovels Platform, and cut right to the chase. The volume here will grow substantially, but we have a few simple ones to get the ball rolling already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/strong&gt;: These include FAQs and other commonly cited issues, so that when you run into a problem you can reassure yourself that you didn’t do anything wrong. And as a bonus, hopefully you’ll be able to solve the issue yourself, using our FAQ answers and Troubleshooting guides as a resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foundations&lt;/strong&gt;: These are the big-hitting, high-level questions that we often get, but don’t have a simple answer for. Things like “How does Shovels even work?” or “How does Shovels decide which permits to include?” or even “When will you have my permit jurisdiction in your system?” will be answered here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/api-reference/" target="_blank"&gt;API Reference&lt;/a&gt; is much more straightforward, and barely has anything added beyond the OpenAPI spec file itself. However, there are a few things of note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;API Playground&lt;/strong&gt;: Try out the endpoints in a live playground without the need to build a script externally. Plug in your API key and away you go!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request Examples&lt;/strong&gt;: We provide example requests in a variety of languages to help you build your queries or scripts. If there’s a language you need that isn’t included today, please &lt;a href="mailto:support@shovels.ai"&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt; and we’ll add it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Request and Response Schemas&lt;/strong&gt;: We clearly define exactly what can go into a response, and what we’ll return. This will make it easy to determine which endpoint to use, and which data to extract from the response.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://docs.shovels.ai/release-notes/release-notes" target="_blank"&gt;Release Notes&lt;/a&gt; are not technically new, but this is the first time we’re officially hosting them statically, for constant and future reference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, these went out in a monthly technical newsletter to the active and power-users of the platform, which contained a list of changes made to the schema, field or parameter names, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new system expands upon this, with the following (broken down by product where applicable):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrades&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breaking Changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bugfixes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End of Life warnings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Platform-wide schema changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will be updated at minimum once a month with our general release, but if we do any mid-month patches then we’ll include those details as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s Staying on the Blog?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the before times, the handy dandy Shovels Blog was where all of this information was sourced. As we expand our platform, individual components will specialize and narrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blog posts about company news, partnerships, customer spotlights, and interesting data analyses will stay on the blog for the foreseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, tutorials (like the Shovels 101 series we began last year) will transition into content in our docs hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as always, when there’s something that we write, on either platform (blog or docs hub), that we’re really excited about, you’ll find it on our &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/shovels/" target="_blank"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next-Gen Shovels Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re scaling things up across the board, and that means shoring up our Support. More and more of you are joining and indicating interest in our platform, which means we need to leverage as much self-service help as we can. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the best problem to have, so it’s something we’re excited about tackling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we can only make our best guesses (informed by our entire backlog of support tickets and customer conversations, so we’re usually close to the mark) as to what kind of resources and support you will need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an open call from us to you: what do you want to see in a documentation hub? What information do you expect, and to what degree? Help us help you, and you’ll have our long-lasting gratitude. We couldn’t be here without you, and we appreciate every little thing along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Check It Out Today!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t already, please give our docs hub a visit at &lt;a href="http://docs.shovels.ai" target="_blank"&gt;docs.shovels.ai&lt;/a&gt;. It will always be a work in progress, but we’re happy with the foundation we’ve built thus far, and it will only continue to grow from here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different neighborhoods and homeowner socio-economics can lead to a wide range of behaviors around maintaining their roofs. Richer areas may see more frequent re-roofing, whereas middle-income areas may prioritize maintenance. And low-income neighborhoods may not have the luxury of such an expensive project. This is commonly understood at an intuitive level, but isn’t the entire picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shovels provides data about individual property permit history, including roofing and re-roofing, which gives us an opportunity to dig deeper into the relationship between household income and roofing permit activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We looked at more than 3,200 census tracts across Texas and combined that with roofing permits and owner demographics to see how the real world matches up against general understanding. Let’s see what the data says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin, there are some obvious findings, which are supported by both conventional wisdom and academic studies, like &lt;a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/home-repairs-and-updates-pose-considerable-burdens-lower-income-homeowners"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; from the Harvard University Joint Center for Housing Studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the board, we find that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Higher income areas show increased permit activity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data shows clear progressions in roof permit activity as income increases, with a striking jump in areas (census tracts) with a median annual income of $100k or greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Roofing permit activity in Texas, by income bracket, averaged per household" src="/images/shovels-roofing-permit-density.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Income (&amp;lt;$30k/year): 0.21 RPD, or &lt;em&gt;Roofing Permit Density&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low-Middle Income ($50k-$75k/year): 0.23 RPD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Middle Income ($75k-$100k/year): 0.29 RPD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upper-Middle Income ($100k-$150k/year): 0.48 RPD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High Income (&amp;gt;$150k/year): 0.51 RPD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;74% of Roofing Permits Come from the Richest 28% of Areas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data is not a surprise, but shows a stark difference in the proportion of roof permits pulled versus the number of households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Modeled proportions of Texas households, by income bracket" src="/images/shovels-analysis-modeled-households.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some additional stats we found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;72% of areas in Texas fall beneath the Upper-Middle bracket, as described above. That’s roughly 3.5 million households.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A massive 58% of areas in Texas make up the Low-Middle bracket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only 4% of areas make up the High Income bracket.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Higher Income areas (Upper-Middle and High brackets) show the widest variation in permit activity, beyond just roofing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Understanding the Wealth-Permit Correlation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings align with broader research and understandings behind homeowner improvement behaviors, and why large-scale projects like roofs are more frequently done by higher income areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several key factors contribute to this trend:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to financial resources&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roofing projects represent a smaller proportion of wealthier homeowner’s budget, both generally and for home improvement projects. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better access to project financing, such as mortgage refinancing, home equity loans, or personal loans with favorable terms. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better access to navigate loans and government-backed programs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Property characteristics and maintenance approaches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wealthier areas often feature older homes requiring more regular or controlled maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wealthier homeowners frequently leverage their greater resources to:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get regular roof inspections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address minor issues promptly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in higher-quality and longer-lasting roofing materials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take preventative measures before major problems develop. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Houses-As-Investment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wealthier homeowners view home improvements as strategic investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wealthier homeowners have better options for temporary housing while major work is done on a given property. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this boils down to what we all intrinsically know: &lt;strong&gt;it’s expensive to be poor, and paying more upfront (in outsourcing labor, better quality materials, and frequent maintenance) is cheaper in the long run. And it’s easier for the wealthy to pay upfront.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Implications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integral nature of roofs to both home quality and value, contrasted with the permitting statistics across areas of different socio-economic backgrounds, paints a stark picture. It’s easier for wealthier areas to do roof work, and so they do. Upper-Middle and High Income areas (by median income) make up the majority of statewide permitting, even though they’re the minority of households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data on its own is nice, but ultimately the value comes from leveraging this data to improve things around us. Shovels is in the business of providing construction insights, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive into some segments that can work with this data to improve home value across the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Policy Makers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing equality is a long-standing issue nationwide, but it’s &lt;a href="https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/fiscal-notes/economics/2024/aff-housing/" target="_blank"&gt;especially present in Texas&lt;/a&gt;. If over a third of homeowners can barely afford their home, how are they expected to front the expenses for a large project like a new roof?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers should investigate longitudinal affordability programs to not only ensure that lower income households can afford housing, but that they can also get the assistance to maintain their home throughout it’s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they should also create cross-industry partnerships to include banks and lending institutions with non-profits and related businesses to help homeowners take care of their roofs, and by extension their homes and investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s cheaper (and greener!) to maintain an existing home than to build and buy a new one, so let’s make that dream a reality for everyone, not just the wealthiest areas. And when the funds are available, the contractors will be happy for the work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Contractors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since the invention of the gang-nail plate (sometimes called a truss connector these days) &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oIeLGkSCMA" target="_blank"&gt;revolutionized the American construction world back in the 50s&lt;/a&gt;, home contractors have switched from building what the homeowners wanted to building what they could, and then selling them the dream of bigger and bigger houses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, as some might put it, Americans gained an appetite for larger and more complex homes, and their incomes didn’t match their dreams. In any case, houses are more expensive and bigger than ever. Combined with rising inflation and stagnating salaries, this is a disaster for the lower and middle classes, and has been for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roofs are just one part of the puzzle. Understanding this roofing problem, and the fact that such a large portion of the available market for roofing projects is in the Lower-Middle income bracket or lower, may unlock substantially more opportunities. Sure there are massive projects funded by the ultra-wealthy that can yield a big paycheck, but sustained work is better for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Homeowners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, homeowners are the ones that benefit the most from increasing the value of their house. In this case, through ensuring that their roof is in excellent condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With better information and resources, every homeowner can understand how to best take care of their roof, whether that’s from regular inspections and maintenance plans, or seeking out financing options to measurably improve their home’s value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And ultimately, roof permitting measured against census tracts and income levels is a great litmus test for how well homeowners are faring, both within their communities and nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship between household income and roof permit activity is one facet of a broader reflection on how socioeconomic patterns influence home ownership and property investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our findings for more than 3,200 census tracts within Texas, wealthier areas showed dramatically disproportionate roof permitting activity compared to less wealthy areas. Beyond the continued alignment with such broader studies, this specifically demonstrates an unbalanced market where Low to Middle Income areas need more assistance with their roofs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address these disparities and inequalities, a nuanced approach is necessary. This is what we might do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement policy measures to support necessary roofing repairs in lower-income areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and educate contractors regarding government-backed programs to help such lower-income areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide more accessible financing options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with businesses, non-profits, and communities to improve access to home improvement resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drive community education and awareness towards the benefits of maintaining their roofs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more roofing permits we see, the better the home quality and value is, which is &lt;a href="https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/swings-in-building-permits-can-help-predict-financial-downturns" target="_blank"&gt;a good thing for everyone&lt;/a&gt; from policy makers to contractors to homeowners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What Next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This narrow study provided some very interesting results, but we can think of additional research we’d like to do. Some key ideas for future analyses are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deeper dive into how this data affects different industries, like insurance, banking, and real estate. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat these analyses for additional states.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measure real, assessed, or modeled home values against permit activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measure contractor-submitted permits versus those done by the homeowner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delineate owner-occupied versus tenant-occupied homes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track historical permit data to determine roof lifespans and associated permitted maintenance or re-roofing work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand our scope beyond roofing to other key signals of home improvement value, like remodels, extensions, or exterior work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The company expanded its engineering team, added stock ticker tracking for permits, and introduced self-serve subscriptions at $599/mo for both Online and API access.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I want to say that January was kind of a lot, that it was pretty intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are phrases I used in high school until a friend told me I can't say that. It's either a lot or it's a little; it's either intense or it's not. It can't be both.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'll say this instead: January was a lot. It was intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why this might be our longest newsletter ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You're getting this email because you reached out to us. We send one big newsletter each month. People seem to like it -- we now have over 4,700 subscribers!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shovels transforms building permit data into actionable insights about contractors, homeowners, and market trends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We post all of our newsletters on our blog. If you want the full recap on what's been going on at Shovels, you can &lt;a href="https://www.shovels.ai/blog/?category=Company"&gt;read them all here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Partnerships galore&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January we pushed forward with three new partners and I'm excited about each of them. You're probably familiar with of these guys: Regrid, Clay, and Cherre. I'll share a bit more about each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regrid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://regrid.com/"&gt;Regrid&lt;/a&gt; is the leader in parcel data. They've been at it the longest, they have the best reputation, and they recently became the official &lt;a href="https://regrid.com/esri"&gt;parcel data partner for Esri&lt;/a&gt;. They're a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last year, we've been asking these three questions: What happens when we merge Regrid parcel data and Shovels permit data together? Do businesses want to buy it? For how much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answers are: &lt;em&gt;It's awesome&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;A lot&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of just a few days ago, we are able to roll Shovels permits into Regrid parcels, unlocking a trove of fascinating site selection, market intelligence, and construction analytics insights. It's really just the beginning of this story and I can't wait to see how it unfolds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In future newsletters we'll have a lot more to say about &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; permits and parcels play so nicely together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written about &lt;a href="https://www.clay.com/"&gt;Clay&lt;/a&gt; here before. Clay is a sales hacking Swiss army knife. It lets you do lead research, data cleansing, scraping, and tons of AI. The the 3rd party integrations are really slick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've had a bunch of people do Shovels integrations with Clay manually, using our API. Well, no need for that anymore! A native integration is in the works. The Clay engineering team is actively working on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clay has been &lt;a href="https://www.clay.com/blog/series-b-expansion"&gt;blowing up recently&lt;/a&gt; and I'm excited for what this will do for our own brand awareness.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cherre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These guys are the leading real estate data marketplace. What they do differently is support the analysis of disparate datasets. So you not only can buy a bunch of different real estate and construction data, but when you get it, it's already tied together with common join keys. This makes it much easier to work across datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're adding building permit and building contractor data into the mix with Cherre. You'll be able to purchase it in bulk from them. See &lt;a href="https://cherre.com/vendors/shovels/#permit-and-construction-data"&gt;our page here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Major updates to Shovels Online and API&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two-and-a-half big updates last month to our phenomenal web app, &lt;a href="https://app.shovels.ai"&gt;Shovels Online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we got rid of our strict 7-day trial! Now you can enjoy a free version of Shovels Online with limited functionality forever. This is the plan for anyone who can't pay $599/mo right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we added new address profile pages and fixed some bugs in our city, county, and jurisdiction pages. They're working a lot better! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a half: we made the date range picker a lot better on contractor and permit searches. Now you can zero in on specific date ranges and the whole thing just makes a lot more sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A new forever free plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want as many people, businesses, researchers, and data wonks as possible to have access to building permit data. In this time of &lt;a href="https://slate.com/business/2025/02/donald-trump-data-deletion-jobs-report-economy-public-health.html"&gt;disappearing data&lt;/a&gt;, it feels even more important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we do have a business to run, bills to pay, etc. So we can't just give it all away. We settled on these options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The free plan&lt;/strong&gt;: access to every permit, contractor, address, and geo profile, but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No downloads to CSV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No viewing address residents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No viewing contractor employees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The $599/mo plan&lt;/strong&gt;: all the free plan access, but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to 1,000 records downloaded at once&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to residents and employees&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Month-to-month, cancel anytime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope this is simple enough for our customers who are no-code and want an easy-to-use dashboard. To make it even more simple, you can upgrade to $599/mo directly in Shovels Online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, we still have our API, so if you need that, you can also purchase it for $599/mo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New address profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These were a long time coming! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our new address profiles (over 30 million of them!) you can see vital stats about the property, like lot size and building area, all the permits and all the contractors who worked on that address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also show derived metrics, like the total value of all the permits pulled on the address. These new profiles are a welcome addition to Shovels Online and complete the set of geographical profiles we set out to build from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a screenshot of a random address in Fremont, CA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="CleanShot 2025-02-11 at 21.38.51@2x.png" src="attachment:7291295c-7851-4ee4-8a00-3b9166e93add:CleanShot_2025-02-11_at_21.38.512x.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A better date picker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have this saying at Shovels: "the little things are the big things." This is a little thing but it's also a big thing. So yes, old high school friend, it's both.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tesla address profile" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/tesla.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Date ranges max out at 90 days! And in the next release we'll order permits so the most recent ones will always be first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A lower free API limit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used to give 1,000 free API pings, but since we're including so much more data in each response, we had to pull that limit back. We're now offering 250 free API pings. If you're over 250 and want to keep using our API, you'll need to subscribe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings me to…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Self-serve subscriptions!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, you can now upgrade Shovels Online and Shovels API directly from your Shovels Online profile! Our web app pricing starts at $599/mo and, possibly by sheer coincidence, our API pricing also starts at $599/mo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check them out by logging in at https://app.shovels.ai and navigating to your profile in the top right corner! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because nothing is worse than jumping through hoops to cancel subscriptions, we give you that ability direcly within Shovels Online. These base plans are month-to-month, cancel any time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can't give you $599 of value every month, that's on us to fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A growing team&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The engineering team spent a majority of December and January in hiring mode. We're super honored to welcome three amazing engineers to the ranks at Shovels. We're now nine strong and plan to hold steady at this headcount for a bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until about a month ago we only had two engineers, my co-founder Luka and our first hire, Petra. I mention that because we got this nice comment on a LinkedIn post recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="LinkedIn post" src="https://www.shovels.ai/images/spencer.png"&gt;
Spencer, we're just warming up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Things to do with permits: Add TICKERS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickers… that'd be a funny way to refer to people on TikTok. But I digress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been talking to some pretty big financial institutions recently and they've urged us to add stock tickers to our permit and contractor datasets. It's a very interesting idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were able to apply tickers to permit &lt;em&gt;contractors&lt;/em&gt; pretty quickly, and we now have building permit history on over 600 publicly-traded businesses. This building permit behavior can be a leading indicator for future growth or a model input to explain past stock performance and earnings reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things also get interesting when we apply tickers to permit &lt;em&gt;addresses&lt;/em&gt;. We can do this on commercial addresses, allowing you to, say, grab all the permits for Starbucks or Google or Target locations. The trick is to get all of the addresses for all of the business locations in the United States. We now have this database, and with a bit of processing focus (maybe some customer interest?), we can do the merge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we'll have the building permits &lt;em&gt;pulled&lt;/em&gt; by public companies and the building permits &lt;em&gt;completed&lt;/em&gt; by public companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can even note when publicly traded companies are mentioned in the permit &lt;em&gt;descriptions&lt;/em&gt;. That's every reference to Whirlpool, LG, Breville, Haier and more across 167 million permits. It could be a very valuable dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the byproduct of tracking all the public companies, of course, is we'll get all the private companies too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving the ball forward, one permit idea at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Congrats, Eagle fans 🦅)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Company"></category><category term="company"></category><category term="newsletter"></category></entry></feed>
